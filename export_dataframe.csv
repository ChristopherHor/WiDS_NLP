in 1971 goodman and rose predicted the occurrence of a fundamental electrostatic limit for the photocurrent in semiconductors at high light intensities blends of conjugated polymers and fullerenes are an ideal model system to observe this space charge limit experimentally since they combine an unbalanced charge transport long lifetimes high charge carrier generation efficiencies and low mobility of the slowest charge carrier the experimental photocurrents reveal all the characteristics of a space charge limited photocurrent a one half power dependence on voltage a three quarter power dependence on light intensity and a one half power scaling of the voltage at which the photocurrent switches into full saturation with light intensity author,Physics
we present pseudopotential coefficients for the first two rows of the periodic table the pseudopotential is of an analytic form that gives optimal efficiency in numerical calculations using plane waves as a basis set at most seven coefficients are necessary to specify its analytic form it is separable and has optimal decay properties in both real and fourier space because of this property the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in fourier space since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system we systematically verify the high accuracy of these pseudopotentials by extensive atomic and molecular test calculations textcopyright,Physics
nose has modified newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical and the isothermal isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an n body system he did this by scaling time with s and distance with v sup 1 d in d dimensions through lagrangian equations of motion the dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta p sub s and p sub v here we develop a slightly different set of equations free of time scaling we find the dynamical steady state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x p sub x v epsilon dot and zeta where the x are reduced distances and the two variables epsilon dot and zeta act as thermodynamic friction coefficients we find that these friction coefficients have gaussian distributions from the distributions the extent of small system non newtonian behavior can be estimated we illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case a one dimensional classical harmonic oscillator author,Physics

a technique is demonstrated for polarization demultiplexing of arbitrary complex modulated signals the technique is based entirely on the observation of samples in stokes space does not involve demodulation and is modulation format independent the data in stokes space is used to find the best fit plane and the normal to it which contains the origin this normal identifies the two orthogonal polarization states of transmission and the desired polarization alignment transformation matrix the technique is verified experimentally and is compared with the constant modulus algorithm author,Physics
we propose that space time at the smallest scales is in reality a causal set a locally finite set of elements endowed with a partial order corresponding to the macroscopic relation that defines past and future we explore how a lorentzian manifold can approximate a causal set noting in particular that the thereby defined effective dimensionality of a given causal set can vary with length scale finally we speculate briefly on the quantum dynamics of causal sets indicating why an appropriate choice of action can reproduce general relativity in the classical limit author,Physics
we propose a new approach towards analytically solving for the dynamical content of conformal field theories cfts using the bootstrap philosophy this combines the original bootstrap idea of polyakov with the modern technology of the mellin representation of cft amplitudes we employ exchange witten diagrams with built in crossing symmetry as our basic building blocks rather than the conventional conformal blocks in a particular channel demanding consistency with the operator product expansion ope implies an infinite set of constraints on operator dimensions and ope coefficients we illustrate the power of this method in the expansion of the wilson fisher fixed point by reproducing anomalous dimensions and strikingly obtaining ope coefficients to higher orders in than currently available using other analytic techniques including feynman diagram calculations our results enable us to get a somewhat better agreement between certain observables in the 3d ising model and the precise numerical values that have been recently obtained author,Physics

objective nin both diagnostic and research applications the interpretation of mr images of the human brain is facilitated when different data sets can be compared by visual inspection of equivalent anatomical planes quantitative analysis with predefined atlas templates often requires the initial alignment of atlas and image planes unfortunately the axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often different in their relative position and orientation and these slices are not coplanar with those in the atlas we have developed a completely automatic method to register a given volumetric data set with talairach stereotaxic coordinate system n n nmaterials and methods nthe registration method is based on multi scale three dimensional 3d cross correlation with an average n gt 300 mr brain image volume aligned with the talariach stereotaxic space once the data set is re sampled by the transformation recovered by the algorithm atlas slices can be directly superimposed on the corresponding slices of the re sampled volume the use of such a standardized space also allows the direct comparison voxel to voxel of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic space n n nresults nwith use of a two tailed student t test for paired samples there was no significant difference in the transformation parameters recovered by the automatic algorithm when compared with two manual landmark based methods p gt 0 1 for all parameters except y scale where p gt 0 05 using root mean square difference between normalized voxel intensities as an unbiased measure of registration we show that when estimated and averaged over 60 volumetric mr images in standard space this measure was 30 lower for the automatic technique than the manual method indicating better registrations likewise the automatic method showed a 57 reduction in standard deviation implying a more stable technique the algorithm is able to recover the transformation even when data are missing from the top or bottom of the volume n n nconclusion nwe present a fully automatic registration method to map volumetric data into stereotaxic space that yields results comparable with those of manually based techniques the method requires no manual identification of points or contours and therefore does not suffer the drawbacks involved in user intervention such as reproducibility and interobserver variability author,Physics
we demonstrate the transfer of information encoded as orbital angular momentum oam states of a light beam the transmitter and receiver units are based on spatial light modulators which prepare or measure a laser beam in one of eight pure oam states we show that the information encoded in this way is resistant to eavesdropping in the sense that any attempt to sample the beam away from its axis will be subject to an angular restriction and a lateral offset both of which result in inherent uncertainty in the measurement this gives an experimental insight into the effects of aperturing and misalignment of the beam on the oam measurement and demonstrates the uncertainty relationship for oam author,Physics

truly remarkable our ability to see colors contributes immeasurably to our ideas of beauty and to the aesthetic appreciation of objects in our everyday world color is used routinely in business industry science and medicine to code and identify objects and to communicate informa tion and finally color seems to be associated with a variety of affective responses feelings emotions and moods such as liking disliking excitement and depression for these reasons it is not surprising to find that there has been a great deal of scientific work done on color vision and color perception richter s two bibliographies 1952 and 1963 for example contain well over 6000 entries even though they cover only the fifteen year period from 1940 through 1954 despite all this work there are many fundamental things we still do not know about this subject as one illustration there is still much uncertainty about precisely how various wave lengths of radiant energy are transformed into nervous energy and differentially coded for transmission to the higher nerve centers of the brain color can be studied anywhere along a broad spectrum of problems at one extreme some scientists are deeply interested in the microfunc tioning of the retinal elements and in the photochemicals that transform electromagnetic energy into nervous energy at the other extreme one can find research workers concerned with responses to color as an aid to understanding the structure and dynamics of personality the problem i wish to discuss falls somewhere near the middle of this spectrum for i am primarily concerned with the common color names that we can all use to talk about our color sensations strangely enough in all the vast literature on color and color percep tion the topic of color names is one that psychologists have largely ignored to be sure studies involving color naming have had a long and respectable history in psychology in fact one of the very earliest of these was begun by james mckeen cattell while he was a fellow at the johns hopkins university in 1882 1883 cattell 1885 but cattell and the many psychologists who used color naming tests after him were interested in these tests almost exclusively as dependent variables typically investigators have used the time taken to name a set of simple colors or the number of errors made in naming some simple colors as a measure of other things mental ability the effect of drugs the effect author,Physics

our previously introduced qtpie charge transfer with polarization current equilibration model j chen and t j martnez chem phys lett 438 315 2007 is a fluctuating charge model with correct asymptotic behavior unlike most other fluctuating charge models qtpie is formulated in terms of charge transfer variables and pairwise electronegativities not atomic charge variables and electronegativities the pairwise character of the electronegativities in qtpie allows us to avoid spurious charge transfer when bonds are broken however the increased number of variables leads to considerable computational expense and a rank deficient set of working equations which is numerically inconvenient here we show that qtpie can be exactly reformulated in terms of atomic charge variables leading to a considerable reduction in computational complexity the transformation between atomic and bond variables is generally applicable to arbitrary fluctuating charge models and uncovers an underlying topological framework that can be used to understand the relation between fluctuating charge models and the classical theory of electrical circuits author,Physics

singletons exist as particles and as local fields only in 3 2 de sitter space their kinematical properties make them natural candidates for constituents of massless fields and perhaps for quarks it is interesting to find out how to describe this type of compositeness in flat space a theory of interacting singleton fields in de sitter space is now available and in this paper we study the flat space limit of the green s functions of that theory the flat space limit is an autonomous theory of green s functions but is not an operator field theory the three point function is calculated and its flat space limit is found to reveal glimpses of a physical interpretation causal and spectral properties are in accord with the tenets of axiomatic field theory the theory is a generalization of local field theory in which photons appear as composite objects although the physical s matrix is the same as in conventional qed author,Physics

the article looks at electrodynamic tether systems which could perform many of the same functions as conventional spacecraft but without the use of chemical or nuclear fuel sources every spacecraft on every mission has to carry all the energy sources required to get its job done typically in the form of chemical propellants photovoltaic arrays or nuclear reactors so scientists are taking a look at an experimentally tested technology the space tether that exploits some fundamental laws of physics to provide pointing artificial gravity electrical power and thrust or drag while reducing or eliminating the need for chemical energy sources many scientists believe that the technology could revolutionize some types of spaceflight tethers exploit the sometimes counterintuitive quirks of orbital mechanics switching on a propulsive electrodynamic tether at the right time along the orbit can produce lateral forces useful for changing the inclination of any spacecraft in orbit an operation that requires a large amount of fuel when it is carried out with chemical thrusters designers will have to devise ways to protect tethers from the effects of the high electrical potential between the tether and the ionosphere as well as from the slow degradation of materials in space and they must learn to control the various vibrations that arise in electrodynamic tether systems insets how electrodynamic tethers work using tethers to remove objects from orbit artificial gravity from a tether tethered missions author,Physics
although carbon has been subjected to far more study than all other elements put together the buckminsterfullerene hollow cage structure recently proposed to account for the exceptional stability of the c 60 cluster has shed a totally new and revealing light on several important aspects of carbon s chemical and physical properties that were quite unsuspected and others that were not previously well understood most significant is the discovery that c 60 appears to form spontaneously and this has particularly important implications for particle formation in combustion and in space as well as for the chemistry of polyaromatic compounds the intriguing revelation that 12 pentagonal defects convert a planar hexagonal array of any size into a quasi icosahedral cage explains why some intrinsically planar materials form quasi crystalline particles as appears to occur in the case of soot although the novel structural proposal has still to be unequivocally confirmed this article pays particular attention to the way in which it provides convincing explanations of puzzling observations in several fields so lending credence to the structure proposed for c 60 author,Physics

breast cancer diagnosis may be improved by optical fluorescence imaging techniques in the near infrared wavelength range we have shown that the recently proposed space space music multiple signal classification algorithm allows the 3 d localization of focal fluorophore tagged lesions in a turbid medium from 2 d fluorescence data obtained from laser excitations at different positions the data are assumed to be measured with two parallel planar sensor arrays on the top and bottom of the medium the laser sources are integrated at different positions in one of the planes the space space data are arranged into an mxn matrix m number of sensors n number of excitation sources a singular value decomposition svd of this matrix yields the detectable number of spot regions with linearly independent behavior with respect to the laser excitation positions and thus allows definition of a signal subspace matches between this signal subspace and data from model spots are tested at scanned points in a model medium viewed as the breast region under study the locations of best matches are then considered the centers of gravity of focal lesions the optical model used was unbounded and optically homogeneous nevertheless simulated spots in bounded inhomogeneous media modeling the breast could be localized accurately author,Physics

existing color constancy methods cannot handle both uniformly colored surfaces and highly textured surfaces in a single integrated framework statistics based methods require many surface colors and become error prone when there are only a few surface colors in contrast dichromatic based methods can successfully handle uniformly colored surfaces but cannot be applied to highly textured surfaces since they require precise color segmentation we present a single integrated method to estimate illumination chromaticity from single colored and multicolored surfaces unlike existing dichromatic based methods the proposed method requires only rough highlight regions without segmenting the colors inside them we show that by analyzing highlights a direct correlation between illumination chromaticity and image chromaticity can be obtained this correlation is clearly described in inverse intensity chromaticity space a novel two dimensional space that we introduce in addition when hough transform and histogram analysis is utilized in this space illumination chromaticity can be estimated robustly even for a highly textured surface author,Physics

space time correlations or eulerian two point two time correlations of fluctuating velocities are analytically and numerically investigated in turbulent shear flows an elliptic model for the space time correlations in the inertial range is developed from the similarity assumptions on the isocorrelation contours they share a uniform preference direction and a constant aspect ratio the similarity assumptions are justified using the kolmogorov similarity hypotheses and verified using the direct numerical simulation dns of turbulent channel flows the model relates the space time correlations to the space correlations via the convection and sweeping characteristic velocities the analytical expressions for the convection and sweeping velocities are derived from the navier stokes equations for homogeneous turbulent shear flows where the convection velocity is represented by the mean velocity and the sweeping velocity is the sum of the random sweeping velocity and the shear induced velocity this suggests that unlike taylor s model where the convection velocity is dominating and kraichnan and tennekes model where the random sweeping velocity is dominating the decorrelation time scales of the space time correlations in turbulent shear flows are determined by the convection velocity the random sweeping velocity and the shear induced velocity this model predicts a universal form of the space time correlations with the two characteristic velocities the dns of turbulent channel flows supports the prediction the correlation functions exhibit a fair good collapse when plotted against the normalized space and time separations defined by the elliptic model author,Physics

abstract the hidden variable question is whether or not various properties randomness or correlation for example that are observed in the outcomes of an experiment can be explained via introduction of extra hidden variables which are unobserved by the experimenter the question can be asked in both the classical and quantum domains in the latter it is fundamental to the interpretation of the quantum formalism bell 1 kochen and specker 9 and others in building a suitable mathematical model of an experiment the physical set up will guide us on how to model the observable variables i e the measurement and outcome spaces but by definition we cannot know what structure to put on the hidden variable space nevertheless we show that under a measure theoretic condition the hidden variable question can be put into a canonical form the condition is that the algebras on the measurement and outcome spaces are countably generated an argument using a classical result on isomorphisms of measure algebras then shows that the hidden variable space can always be taken to be the unit interval equipped with the lebesgue measure on the borel sets author,Physics
although charged particles in space have been detected with radiation detectors on board spacecraft since the discovery of the van allen belts reports on the effects of direct exposure to space radiation in biological systems have been limited measurement of biological effects of space radiation is challenging due to the low dose and low dose rate nature of the radiation environment and due to the difficulty in distinguishing the radiation effects from microgravity and other space environmental factors in astronauts only a few changes such as increased chromosome aberrations in their lymphocytes and early onset of cataracts are attributed primarily to their exposure to space radiation in this study cultured human fibroblasts were flown on the international space station iss cells were kept at 37c in space for 14 days before being fixed for analysis of dna damage with the h2ax assay the 3 dimensional h2ax foci were captured with a laser confocal microscope quantitative analysis revealed several foci that were larger and displayed a track pattern only in the day 14 flight samples to confirm that the foci data from the flight study was actually induced from space radiation exposure cultured human fibroblasts were exposed to low dose rate rays at 37c cells exposed to chronic rays showed similar foci size distribution in comparison to the non exposed controls the cells were also exposed to low and high let protons and high let fe ions on the ground our results suggest that in g1 human fibroblasts under the normal culture condition only a small fraction of large size foci can be attributed to high let radiation in space author,Physics

a modeling and validation method of photometric characteristics of the space target was presented in order to track and identify different satellites effectively the background radiation characteristics models of the target were built based on blackbody radiation theory the geometry characteristics of the target were illustrated by the surface equations based on its body coordinate system the material characteristics of the target surface were described by a bidirectional reflectance distribution function model which considers the character of surface gauss statistics and microscale self shadow and is obtained by measurement and modeling in advance the contributing surfaces of the target to observation system were determined by coordinate transformation according to the relative position of the space based target the background radiation sources and the observation platform then a mathematical model on photometric characteristics of the space target was built by summing reflection components of all the surfaces photometric characteristics simulation of the space based target was achieved according to its given geometrical dimensions physical parameters and orbital parameters experimental validation was made based on the scale model of the satellite the calculated results fit well with the measured results which indicates the modeling method of photometric characteristics of the space target is correct author,Physics
in a causal world the direction of the time arrow dictates how past causal events in a variable x produce future effects in y x is said to cause an effect in y if the predictability uncertainty about the future states of y increases decreases as its own past and the past of x are taken into consideration causality is thus intrinsic dependent on the observation of the past events of both variables involved to the prediction or uncertainty reduction of future event of the other variable we will show that this temporal notion of causality leads to another natural spatiotemporal definition for it and that can be exploited to detect the arrow of influence from x to y either by considering shorter time series of x and longer time series of y an approach that explores the time nature of causality or lower precision measured time series in x and higher precision measured time series in y an approach that explores the spatial nature of causality causality has thus space and time signatures causing a break of symmetry in the topology of the probabilistic space or causing a break of symmetry in the length of the measured time series a consequence of the fact that information flows from x to y author,Physics
fourier ptychographic microscopy fpm is a new computational super resolution approach which can obtain not only the correct object function but also the pupil aberration the led misalignment and beyond although many state mixed fpm techniques have been proposed to achieve higher data acquisition efficiency and recovery accuracy in the past few years little is known that their reconstruction performance highly depends on the data redundancy in both object and frequency domains generally at least 35 aperture overlapping percentage in the fourier domain is needed for a successful reconstruction using ordinary fpm method however the data redundancy requirements for those state mixed fpm schemes are largely remained unexplored until now in this paper we explore the spatial and spectrum data redundancy requirements for the fpm recovery process to introduce sampling criteria for the conventional and state mixed fpm techniques in both object and frequency space moreover an upsampled fpm method is proposed to solve the pixel aliasing problem and an alternative illumination angle subsampled fpm scheme is introduced to get rid of the complexity of decoherence and achieve the expected recovery quality with reduced data quantity all the proposed methods and sampling criteria are validated with both simulations and experiments and our results show that state mixed techniques cannot provide a significant performance advantage since they are much more sensitive to data redundancy this paper provides both the guidelines for designing the most suitable fpm platform and the insights for the capabilities and limitations of the fpm approach author,Physics

a region of two dimensional space has been filled randomly with a large number of growing circular disks allowing only a slight overlapping among them just before their growth stops more specifically each disk grows from a nucleation center that is selected at a random location within the uncovered region the growth rate is a continuously tunable parameter of the problem which assumes a specific value while a particular pattern of disks is generated when a growing disk overlaps for the first time with at least one other disk its growth is stopped and is said to be frozen in this paper we study the percolation properties of the set of frozen disks using numerical simulations we present evidence for the following i the order parameter appears to jump discontinuously at a certain critical value of the area coverage ii the width of the window of the area coverage needed to observe a macroscopic jump in the order parameter tends to vanish as 0 and on the contrary iii the cluster size distribution has a power law decaying functional form while the first two results are the signatures of a discontinuous transition the third result is indicative of a continuous transition therefore we refer to this transition as a sharp but continuous transition similar to what has been observed in the recently introduced achlioptas process of explosive percolation it is also observed that in the limit of 0 the critical area coverage at the transition point tends to unity implying that the limiting pattern is space filling in this limit the fractal dimension of the pore space at the percolation point has been estimated to be 1 42 10 and the contact network of the disk assembly is found to be a scale free network author,Physics

starting from the physical problem associated with the lorentzian transformation of a poisson kac process in inertial frames the concept of space time modulated stochastic processes is introduced for processes possessing finite propagation velocity this class of stochastic processes provides a two way coupling between the stochastic perturbation acting on a physical observable and the evolution of the physical observable itself which in turn influences the statistical properties of the stochastic perturbation during its evolution the definition of space time modulated processes requires the introduction of two functions a nonlinear amplitude modulation controlling the intensity of the stochastic perturbation and a time horizon function which modulates its statistical properties providing irreducible feedback between the stochastic perturbation and the physical observable influenced by it the latter property is the peculiar fingerprint of this class of models that makes them suitable for extension to generic curved space times considering poisson kac processes as prototypical examples of stochastic processes possessing finite propagation velocity the balance equations for the probability density functions associated with their space time modulations are derived several examples highlighting the peculiarities of space time modulated processes are thoroughly analyzed author,Physics
national space agencies are planning a human mission to mars in the xxi century space radiation is generally acknowledged as a potential showstopper for this mission for two reasons a high uncertainty on the risk of radiation induced morbidity and b lack of simple countermeasures to reduce the exposure the need for radiation exposure mitigation tools in a mission to mars is supported by the recent measurements of the radiation field on the mars science laboratory shielding is the simplest physical countermeasure but the current materials provide poor reduction of the dose deposited by high energy cosmic rays accelerator based tests of new materials can be used to assess additional protection in the spacecraft active shielding is very promising but as yet not applicable in practical cases several studies are developing technologies based on superconducting magnetic fields in space reducing the transit time to mars is arguably the best solution but novel nuclear thermal electric propulsion systems also seem to be far from practical realization it is likely that the first mission to mars will employ a combination of these options to reduce radiation exposure author,Physics
space and astrophysical plasmas often develop into a turbulent state and exhibit nearly random and stochastic motions while earlier studies emphasize more on understanding the energy spectrum of turbulence in the one dimensional context either in the frequency or the wavenumber domain recent achievements in plasma turbulence studies provide an increasing amount of evidence that plasma turbulence is essentially a spatially and temporally evolving phenomenon this review presents various models for the spacetime structure and anisotropy of the turbulent fields in space plasmas or equivalently the energy spectra in the wavenumberfrequency domain for the spacetime structures and that in the wavevector domain for the anisotropies the turbulence energy spectra are evaluated in different one dimensional spectral domains one speaks of the frequency spectra in the spacecraft observations and the wavenumber spectra in the numerical simulation studies the notion of the wavenumberfrequency spectrum offers a more comprehensive picture of the turbulent fields and good models can explain the one dimensional spectra in the both domains at the same time to achieve this goal the doppler shift the doppler broadening linear mode dispersion relations and sideband waves are reviewed the energy spectra are then extended to the wavevector domain spanning the directions parallel and perpendicular to the large scale magnetic field by doing so the change in the spectral index at different projections onto the one dimensional spectral domain can be explained in a simpler way author,Physics

we demonstrate pretransition effects in space time in trajectories of systems in which the dynamics displays a first order phase transition between distinct dynamical phases these effects are analogous to those observed for thermodynamic first order phase transitions most notably the hydrophobic effect in water considering the infinite temperature east model as an elementary example we study the properties of space time solvation by examining trajectories where finite space time regions are conditioned to be inactive in an otherwise active phase we find that solvating an inactive region of space time within an active trajectory shows two regimes in the dynamical equivalent of solvation free energy an entropic small solute regime in which uncorrelated fluctuations are sufficient to evacuate activity from the solute and an energetic large solute regime which involves the formation of a solute induced inactive domain with an associated active inactive interface bearing a dynamical interfacial tension we also show that as a result of this dynamical interfacial tension there is a dynamical analog of the hydrophobic collapse that drives the assembly of large hydrophobes in water we discuss the general relevance of these results to the properties of dynamical fluctuations in systems with slow collective relaxation such as glass formers author,Physics

frame rate in ultrasound imaging can be dramatically increased by using sparse synthetic transmit aperture sta beamforming techniques the two main drawbacks of the method are the low signal to noise ratio snr and the motion artifacts that degrade the image quality in this paper we propose a spatio temporal encoding for sta imaging based on simultaneous transmission of two quasi orthogonal tapered linear fm signals the excitation signals are an up and a down chirp with frequency division and a cross talk of 55 db the received signals are first cross correlated with the appropriate code then spatially decoded and finally beamformed for each code yielding two images per emission the spatial encoding is a hadamard encoding previously suggested by chiao et al in proceedings of the ieee ultrasonics symposium 1997 p 1679 the hadamard matrix has half the size of the transmit element groups due to the orthogonality of the temporal encoded wavefronts thus with this method the frame rate is doubled compared to previous systems another advantage is the utilization of temporal codes which are more robust to attenuation with the proposed technique it is possible to obtain images dynamically focused in both transmit and receive with only two firings this reduces the problem of motion artifacts the method has been tested with extensive simulations using field ii resolution and snr are compared with uncoded sta imaging and conventional phased array imaging the range resolution remains the same for coded sta imaging with four emissions and is slightly degraded for sta imaging with two emissions due to the 55 db cross talk between the signals the additional proposed temporal encoding adds more than 15 db on the snr gain yielding a snr at the same order as in phased array imaging author,Physics

recently a framework was established to systematically construct novel universal resource states for measurement based quantum computation using techniques involving finitely correlated states with these methods universal states were found which are in certain ways much less entangled than the original cluster state model and it was hence believed that with this approach many of the extremal entanglement features of the cluster states could be relaxed the new resources were constructed as computationally universal states i e they allow one to efficiently reproduce the classical output of each quantum computation whereas the cluster states are universal in a stronger sense since they are universal state preparators here we show that the new resources are universal state preparators after all and must therefore exhibit a whole class of extremal entanglement features similar to the cluster states author,Physics

spores of bacillus subtilis were exposed to selected factors of space vacuum solar uv radiation heavy ions of cosmic radiation and their response was studied after recovery these investigations were supplemented by ground based studies under simulated space conditions the vacuum of space did not inactivate the spores however vacuum induced structural changes in the dna and probably in the proteins caused a supersensitivity to solar uv radiation this phenomenon is caused by the production of specific photoproducts in dna and protein which cannot be removed by normal cellular repair processes in vegetative bacterial cells exposed to vacuum cell dehydration led to damage of the cell membrane which could be partly repaired during subsequent incubation the high local effectiveness of the cosmic heavy ions further decreases the chance that spores can survive for any length of time in space nonetheless a spore travelling through space and protected from ultraviolet radiation could possibly survive an interplanetary journey such a situation favors panspermia as a possible explanation for the origin of life author,Physics

we propose a phase space wigner harmonics entropy measure for many body quantum dynamical complexity this measure which reduces to the well known measure of complexity in classical systems and which is valid for both pure and mixed states in single particle and many body systems takes into account the combined role of chaos and entanglement in the realm of quantum mechanics the effectiveness of the measure is illustrated in the example of the ising chain in a homogeneous tilted magnetic field we provide numerical evidence that the multipartite entanglement generation leads to a linear increase in entropy until saturation in both integrable and chaotic regimes so that in both cases the number of harmonics of the wigner function grows exponentially with time the entropy growth rate can be used to detect quantum phase transitions the proposed entropy measure can also distinguish between integrable and chaotic many body dynamics by means of the size of long term fluctuations which become smaller when quantum chaos sets in author,Physics

the risk of combined injury ci to space travelers is a function of exposure to anomalously large surges of a broad spectrum of particulate and photon radiations conventional trauma t and effects of weightlessness including decreased intravascular fluid volume and myocardial deconditioning ci may occur even at relatively low doses of radiation which can synergistically enhance morbidity and mortality from t without effective countermeasures prolonged residence in space is expected to predispose most individuals to bone fractures as a result of calcium loss in the microgravity environment immune dysfunction may occur from residence in space independent of radiation exposure thus wound healing would be compromised if infection were to occur survival of the space traveler with ci would be significantly compromised if there were delays in wound closure or in the application of simple supportive medical or surgical therapies particulate radiation has the potential for causing greater gastrointestinal injury than photon radiation but bone healing should not be compromised at the expected doses of either type of radiation in space author,Physics

a systematic perturbation scheme is developed for approximate solutions to the time dependent schrdinger equation with a space adiabatic hamiltonian for a particular isolated energy band the basic approach is to separate kinematics from dynamics the kinematics is defined through a subspace of the full hilbert space for which transitions to other band subspaces are suppressed to all orders and the dynamics operates in that subspace in terms of an effective intraband hamiltonian as novel applications we discuss the born oppenheimer theory to second order and derive for the first time the nonperturbative definition of the g factor of the electron within nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics author,Physics
for optical interconnects to become a mature technology they must be amenable to electronic packaging technology two main obstacles to including free space optical interconnects are alignment and heat dissipation issues here we study the issues of alignment tolerancing that are due to assembly and manufacturing variations passive element tolerancing over long board level distances gt 10 cm for free space optical interconnects we also combine these variations with active optoelectronic device variations active element tolerancing we demonstrate a computer aided analysis procedure that permits one to determine both active and passive element tolerances needed to achieve some system level specification such as yield or cost the procedure that we employ relies on developing a detailed design of the system to be studied in a standard optical design program such as code v using information from this model we can determine the integrated power falling on the detector which we term optical throughput by performing gaussian propagation or general fresnel propagation if significant vignetting occurs this optical throughput can be used to determine system level performance criteria such as bit error rate with this computer aided analysis technique a sensitivity analysis of all the variations under study is made on a system with realistic board level interconnect distances to find each perturbation s relative effects with other perturbations set to 0 on the power falling on the detector this information is used to set initial tolerances for subsequent tolerancing analysis and design runs a tolerancing analysis by monte carlo techniques is applied to determine if the yield or cost yield is denned as the percentage of systems that have acceptable system performance is acceptable with a technique called parametric sampling a subsequent tolerancing design run can be applied to optimize this yield or cost with little increase in computation we study a design example and show that most of the tolerances can be achieved with current technology author,Physics

in this letter we explain the puzzling sign change of organic magnetoresistance in space charge limited devices by device physics we prove analytically and numerically that in the case of bipolar conduction with an ohmic majority carrier and an injection limited minority carrier contact a decrease in minority carrier mobility may give rise to an increase in the device current it is shown that when the magnetic field acts to decrease the mobility of both carriers a sign change in the magnetoconductivity as a function of applied bias may result this behavior is in agreement with experimental observations author,Physics
we study the potential energy surface pes sampled by a liquid modeled via the widely studied extended simple point charge spc e model for water we characterize the curvature of the pes by calculating the instantaneous normal mode inm spectrum for a wide range of densities and temperatures we discuss the information contained in the inm density of states which requires additional processing to be unambiguously associated with the long time dynamics for the spc e model we find that the slowing down of the dynamics in the supercooled region where the ideal mode coupling theory has been used to describe the dynamics is controlled by the reduction in the number of directions in configuration space that allow a structural change we find that the fraction f dw of the double well directions in configuration space determines the value of the diffusion constant d thereby relating a property of the pes to a macroscopic dynamic quantity specifically it appears that square root d is approximately linear in f dw our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that at the mode coupling crossover temperature dynamical processes based on the free exploration of configuration space vanish and processes requiring activation dominate hence the reduction of the number of directions allowing free exploration of configuration space is the mechanism of diffusion implicitly implemented in the ideal mode coupling theory additionally we find a direct relationship between the number of basins sampled by the system and the number of free directions in this picture diffusion appears to be related to geometrical properties of the pes and to be entropic in origin author,Physics
evaluation and monitoring of the cancer risk from space radiation exposure is a crucial requirement for the success of long term space missions one important task in the risk calculation is to properly weigh the various components of space radiation dose according to their assumed contribution to the cancer risk relative to the risk associated with radiation of low ionization density currently quality factors of radiation both on the ground and in space are defined by national and international commissions based on existing radiobiological data and presumed knowledge of the ionization density distribution of the radiation field at a given point of interest this approach makes the determination of the average quality factor ofa given radiation field a rather complex task in this contribution we investigate the possibility to define quality factors of space radiation exposure based on nanodosimetric data the underlying formalism of the determination of quality factors on the basis of nanodosimetric data is described and quality factors for protons and ions helium and carbon of different energies based on simulated nanodosimetric data are presented the value and limitations of this approach are discussed author,Physics
background ncells are not mixed bags of signaling molecules as a consequence signals must travel from their origin to distal locations much is understood about the purely diffusive propagation of signals through space many signals however propagate via signaling cascades here we show that depending on their kinetics cascades speed up or slow down the propagation of signals through space relative to pure diffusion n n nmethodology principal findings nwe modeled simple cascades operating under different limits of michaelis menten kinetics using deterministic reaction diffusion equations cascades operating far from enzyme saturation speed up signal propagation the second mobile species moves more quickly than the first through space on average the enhanced speed is due to more efficient serial activation of a downstream signaling module by the signaling molecule immediately upstream in the cascade at points distal from the signaling origin compared to locations closer to the source conversely cascades operating under saturated kinetics which exhibit zero order ultrasensitivity can slow down signals ultimately localizing them to regions around the origin n n nconclusions significance nsignal speed modulation may be a fundamental function of cascades affecting the ability of signals to penetrate within a cell to cross react with other signals and to activate distant targets in particular enhanced speeds provide a way to increase signal penetration into a cell without needing to flood the cell with large numbers of active signaling molecules conversely diminished speeds in zero order ultrasensitive cascades facilitate strong but localized signaling author,Physics

during the last two decades we modelled the behaviour of a large number of systems we noted that different styles of modelling had quite an effect on the size of the state spaces of the modelled system the differences were so substantial that some specification styles led to far too many states to verify the correctness of the model whereas with other styles the number of states was so small that verification was a straightforward activity in this article we summarise our experience by providing seven specification guidelines for each guideline we provide an application from the realm of traffic light controllers for which we provide a bad model with a large state space and a good model with a small state space author,Physics

the realization of the economic value of the genetic resources has prompted an international debate about property rights to genetic resources the international debate pertaining to patenting of genetic material is the main theme of this chapter as a backdrop for the international debate the chapter starts out with a summary of the main events and arguments in the expanding scope of patent legislation in biotechnological inventions summing up the new biotechnologies represent a tool which meets the legal requirements for patenting biological material from the industry s point of view biotechnology also necessitates patenting on the negative side defending a patent is often a long and costly business and the trend is that patenting will mainly benefit the bigger and stronger companies and thus weaken public control over the rapid developments in biotechnology a central argument in the chapter is that without sophisticated biotechnological tools trained scientists and adequate infrastructure patenting is as yet hardly a viable solution for the majority of developing countries gene rich developing countries fear that developments in patent legislation will pave the way for increased northern control over third world natural resources the international convention on biological diversity goes some way in making amends to this situation but the gene poor least developed countries may still have reason to fear that they will lose access to breeding material in a long term perspective the implications may be detrimental for resource conservation in developing countries in conclusion the patent question seems to remain unresolved and may still be one of the most likely stumbling blocks for future ratifications and implementation of the biodiversity convention author,Political Science

statistics are widely applied throughout scientific research disciplines but statistical evidence sounds surely an unhappy term rather avoided in international criminal law the term seems to stress the value that statistical methods have for the analysis of large scale victimisation and describes rather the tools used to support the evidence however statistics is required for valid reliable and objective results that would otherwise be left in the dusty political sphere of the warring parties and their actors but what are the concepts to do so today s presentation shows two widely known cases from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty where statisticians analysed the crime scenes in srebrenica and kosovo the cases introduce two different analytical approaches firstly in srebrenica the analysts focussed on civilians that were killed during the take over of the enclave thus the findings are descriptive summarizing observations and presenting results based on simple statistical tools secondly in kosovo the researchers asked what caused the killings and refugee migration during the nato air campaign in springtime 1999 here in a complex environment statistical methods are exercised to determine causal relations hypotheses are tested to be consistent with huge data sets collected from a broad field of sources to finally end up with statistical evidence author,Political Science

network science has spurred a reexamination of relational phenomena in political science including the study of international conflict we introduce a new direction to the study of conflict by showing that the multiplex fractionalization of the international system along three key dimensions is a powerful predictor of the propensity for violent interstate conflict even after controlling for well established conflict indicators our new measure contributes more to model fit for interstate conflict than all of the previously established measures combined moreover joint democracy plays little if any role in predicting system stability thus challenging perhaps the major empirical finding of the international relations literature lastly the temporal variability of our measure with conflict is consistent with a causal relationship our results have real world policy implications as changes in our fractionalization measure substantially aid the prediction of conflict up to 10 years into the future allowing it to serve as an early warning sign of international instability author,Political Science

international students offer a unique window into the role environmental factors play in driving obesity nave estimates of the relationship between environmental factors and obesity are often plagued by reverse causation sample selection and omitted variable bias in this study we survey international students at 40 public universities across the united states we use this unique data to link the weight gain of international students to the prevalence of obesity where they live we argue that our estimates are less likely to be biased as international students have limited control over the environment to which they are exposed upon arrival in the united states we find that students living in areas with a higher prevalence of obesity show a biologically important and statistically significantly greater increase in weight as compared to those living in areas with a lower prevalence of obesity results provide cautious evidence that environmental characteristics of a region can affect the weight gain of individuals author,Political Science

todays struggle to control the ebola outbreak in west africa is a reminder that trust within health systems is absolutely crucial to fi ght diseasenot only locally but also globally we describe rwandas experience with a breakdown of communication accountability and trust that threatened the great strides in malaria control made over the past decade rwanda has formalised a series of national strategic plans since 2005 all of which rely on evidence based methods to combat the burden of malaria a key component of this arsenal includes a commitment to achieve universal coverage of long lasting insecticidetreated bednets especially for the most vulnerable people eg pregnant women and children under 5 years of age coupled with robust policies on health system strengthening these plans have achieved dramatic reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality yet rwanda witnessed an unprecedented rise in malaria cases in 2012 table rwandas ministry of health responded in accordance with its national strategic plan and with means approved by who millions of additional who recommended long lasting insecticide treated bednets were distributed in districts with a high burden of malaria and to all children younger than 5 years of age unfortunately unlike during previous upsurges the number of malaria cases continued to rise despite these eff orts the predictable reasons for this rise such as the expansion of water bodies for rice cultivation climatic anomalies and increase in insecticide resistance could not fully explain the sharp rise in malaria cases after these interventions so rwandas ministry of health actively investigated the issue results of national laboratory analyses completed in september 2013 revealed that the distributed insecticide treated bednets were impregnated with suboptimum concentrations of insecticide and thereby failed to meet who required bioeffi cacy standards for prequalifi cation these results were later confi rmed by the us centers for disease control and prevention on learning of the substandard product rwandas ministry of health removed the bednets from circulation nationwide and had to identify an alternative course of action to protect its people although even fully operational and eff ective bednets alone could not have prevented the rise in malaria the ineff ective product only exacerbated the challenging situation to have invested in the purchase and distribution of a substandard product only to have to subsequently remove it was not only a waste of money but also of precious time that could have been devoted to other crucial development priorities in october 2013 1 month after rwanda had recalled and replaced the substandard bednets member states received notifi cation from the who pesticide evaluation scheme that this particular brand of bednets were no longer recommended for use owing to their substandard performance in trials of their effi cacy against malaria of particular concern however was that this recommendation had been made in july 2013 nearly 4 months before rwanda and several other countries were notifi ed of these fi ndings by who such an unnecessary delay serves as a sobering reminder that we must expect and demand greater international accountability in the global health arena it is alarming that who did not alert member states sooner so that health authorities could make expedient and informed decisions to protect their people from malaria withholding information about substandard products erodes trust in the international normative agencies that are supposed to protect the interests and rights of vulnerable people moreover concerns about the infl uence of non state actors eg business interests on international agencies are not alleviated by these types of incidents erosion of trust and perception of bureaucratic ineffi ciency might translate into budget shortfalls for entities such as the who which would hamper its ability to manage global health challenges such as the ebola crisis in the present and author,Political Science

international collaboration in science continues to grow at a remarkable rate but little agreement exists about dynamics of growth and organization at the discipline level some suggest that disciplines differ in their collaborative tendencies reflecting their epistemic culture this study examines collaborative patterns in six previously studied specialties to add new data and conduct analyses over time our findings show that the global network of collaboration continues to add new nations and new participants each specialty has added many new nations to its lists of collaborating partners since 1990 we also find that the scope of international collaboration is positively related to impact network characteristics for the six specialties are notable in that instead of reflecting underlying culture they tend towards convergence this observation suggests that the global level may represent next order dynamics that feed back to the national and local levels as subsystems in a complex networked hierarchy author,Political Science

relative to a particular level of female mortality male mortality is lower than expected currently and historically in northwestern europe southeastern europe and tropical latin america it is higher than expected in western central europe and in the far east the geographical pattern of differentials is attributable primarily to variation in the masculinity of mortality from cardiovascular diseases neoplasms and influenza pneumonia bronchitis over time male mortality has increased relative to a particular level of female mortality and these same causes of death are principally responsible in the 1960 s high masculinity of mortality was associated independently with low proportions in primary activities high proportions hiring in large cities and with high discrimination against females in school enrollment combined with poor nutritional standards the former two variables once again operate primarily through cardiovascular disease neoplasms and the respiratory diseases whereas the discrimination nutrition interaction appears to operate through infectious diseases variations in levels of economic modernization are capable of accounting for a substantial portion of the regional differences although certain constitutional factors such as physiotype are also plausibly implicated and they are also congruent with trends in sex mortality differentials author,Political Science

making the rules of health care resource allocation transparent is a challenge for all governments the oregon health plan in the late 1980s was one such attempt to prioritise expenditure of limited medicaid funds based on public values 1 for decision makers asking the general public and health professionals to express their preferences for health care spending priorities can be a way of ensuring that the process and resultant spending priorities are seen as legitimate and fair 2 in a study comparing the preferences of health professionals and members of the public for setting health care priorities wiseman found considerable uniformity in preferences between the two groups 2 however some members of the public argued that it would be better to trust health professionals to make the correct decision in the first place n nthose entrusted to set health care priorities do so according to what is in the best interest of the public this in turn requires those decision makers to make value judgments on what constitutes good on what basis should one health program deserve a higher priority for funding than another several studies have found that the general public and health professionals may not agree on who and what is most deserving of scarce health resources n nbased on an opinion poll groves showed that the public strongly disagreed with doctors and health managers on where best to spend health resources 3 myllykangas and colleagues in a study on attitudes to health care priorities found that doctors and nurses were less inclined to be punitive towards funding for patients with self induced diseases than the general public 4 yet dolan et al found that when the public were given time to listen to the considered opinions of their fellow citizens and reflect on their views fewer were willing to discriminate against people with what might be regarded as self induced diseases 5 n nin all cases it is values the building blocks or rules which govern attitudes and behaviour that are reflected in priorities for spending in health care 6 7 the values of the decision makers clearly count in setting health care expenditure priorities so do decision makers themselves share common values about priorities for health care spending are there any similarities in values between decision makers in different countries n nthe purpose of this study is to compare spending priorities for health care across a selection of predominantly middle income countries based on the opinions of current and future decision makers using an opinion poll questionnaire we surveyed 253 health professionals from six countries asking them to rank ten health interventions in order of priority for spending from most important rank 1 to least important rank 10 the questionnaire was based on a short questionnaire on priorities for health care spending developed by groves 3 n nthe questionnaire asked respondents to imagine that they were responsible for health care spending in their country this was followed by a question on whether or not they thought that funding for health care should be unlimited no additional information was given to respondents the survey was designed as an introductory learning exercise for a series of intensive workshops of three to ten days duration run under the auspices of the world health organization or ausaid the australian government s overseas aid program south africa workshop only on the application of evidence based medicine and economic evaluation to the selection and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals the intention was to introduce course participants to the notion of priority setting the questionnaire was administered at the beginning of each workshop details of the study setting and participants questions used to prompt group discussion and the data analysis are outlined in text s1 author,Political Science

this article presents two approaches that have dominated international relations in their approach to the international politics of health the statist approach which is primarily security focused seeks to link health initiatives to a foreign or defence policy remit the globalist approach in contrast seeks to advance health not because of its intrinsic security value but because it advances the well being and rights of individuals this article charts the evolution of these approaches and demonstrates why both have the potential to shape our understanding of the evolving global health agenda it examines how the statist and globalist perspectives have helped shape contemporary initiatives in global health governance and suggests that there is evidence of an emerging convergence between the two perspectives this convergence is particularly clear in the articulation of a number of un initiatives in this area especially the one world one health strategic framework and the oslo ministerial declaration 2007 which inspired the first un general assembly resolution on global health and foreign policy in 2009 and the un secretary general s note global health and foreign policy strategic opportunities and challenges what remains to be seen is whether this convergence will deliver on securing states interest long enough to promote the interests of the individuals who require global efforts to deliver local health improvements author,Political Science

in the universal declaration of human rights the foundation of human rights the text and negotiating history of the right to life explicitly premises human rights on birth likewise other international and regional human rights treaties as drafted and or subsequently interpreted clearly reject claims that human rights should attach from conception or any time before birth they also recognise that women s right to life and other human rights are at stake where restrictive abortion laws are in place this paper reviews the international covenant on civil and political rights the convention on the rights of the child and the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms the inter american human rights agreements and african charter on human and people s rights in this regard no one has the right to subordinate another in the way that unwanted pregnancy subordinates a woman by requiring her to risk her own health and life to save her own child thus the long standing insistence of women upon voluntary motherhood is a demand for minimal control over one s destiny as a human being from a human rights perspective to depart from voluntary motherhood would impose upon women an extreme form of discrimination and forced labour author,Political Science

in most societies health professionals traditionally carry responsibility only toward their patients however this is not the case in all cultures in the contemporary practice of oncology in western cultures there is a shift toward assuming broader responsibility for patients with cancer families during the illness course the grieving stage and in cancer prevention and genetic counseling traditional family community and religious values play a central role in determining people s perceptions and attitudes toward life and death as well as toward caregiving for a sick relative the meaning of cancer illness within the family culture is thus influenced not only by each individual s values and beliefs but also by the family s makeup and dynamics as well as their taboos and secrets global cancer care should therefore be directed at the family as a unit while respecting patient autonomy and privacy this reappraisal of our traditional understanding of physicians duty as solely directed at the patient is reflected in the recent us trend toward a patient and family centered care approach an additional challenge for oncology professionals is to integrate and tailor interventions toward the needs of both care recipients and caregivers and relate it to this dyad as the basic and enduring unit of care author,Political Science
background nwhen the zika virus outbreak became a global health emergency in early 2016 the scientific community responded with an increased output of zika related research this upsurge in research naturally made its way into academic journals along with editorials news and reports however it is not yet known how or whether these scholarly communications were distributed to the populations most affected by zika n n nmethodology principal findings nto understand how scientific outputs about zika reached global and local audiences we collected tweets and facebook posts that linked to zika related research in the first six months of 2016 using a language detection algorithm we found that up to 90 of twitter and 76 of facebook posts are in english however when none of the authors of the scholarly article are from english speaking countries posts on both social media are less likely to be in english the effect is most pronounced on facebook where the likelihood of posting in english is between 11 and 16 lower when none of the authors are from english speaking countries as compared to when some or all are similarly posts about papers written with a brazilian author are 13 more likely to be in portuguese on facebook than when made on twitter n n nconclusions significance nour main conclusion is that scholarly communication on twitter and facebook of zika related research is dominated by english despite brazil being the epicenter of the zika epidemic this result suggests that scholarly findings about the zika virus are unlikely to be distributed directly to relevant populations through these popular online mediums nevertheless there are differences between platforms compared to twitter scholarly communication on facebook is more likely to be in the language of an author s country the zika outbreak provides a useful case study for understanding how scientific outputs are communicated to relevant populations our results suggest that facebook is a more effective channel than twitter if communication is desired to be in the native language of the affected country further research should explore how local media such as governmental websites newspapers and magazines as well as television and radio disseminate scholarly publication author,Political Science
the fact that more than 10 million people fall ill with tuberculosis annually and that 5000 die of it every day including about 1000 because of hiv associated infection speaks to the gravity of the global problem of tuberculosis tuberculosis has many other dubious distinctions that merit attention it is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind and yet one of the top ten global causes of death today the top infectious cause of death worldwide the top killer of people with hiv infection and a top cause of death due to antimicrobialresistant infections bearing this in mind investing in the fight against tuberculosis is a no brainer development target according to the economist and the copenhagen consensus given the benefits gained per dollar spent countries have committed as part of the whos end tb strategy and the sustainable development goals sdgs to ending the tuberculosis epidemic by 2030 the stop tb partnerships global plan to end tb 20162020 laid out the estimated financing needs for the first 5 years in implementing the end tb strategy yet in 2016 who reported that the world was failing to accelerate actions to meet the first milestones towards these targets at the end of 2016 there finally seemed to be a swell of political recognition of the problem in view of the dire facts and growing vocal demand from people affected by tuberculosis first who and the russian federation decided to hold the very first who global ministerial conference on ending tb nov 1617 2017 to stimulate action and commitments second the un general assembly announced the first ever high level meeting on the fight against tuberculosis in 2018 third in july 2017 the g20 leaders recognised that acting on priority pathogens including tuberculosis is a crucial part of global efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance fourth at the meeting of the brazil russia india china and south africa brics leaders in september 2017 these countries committed to combat tuberculosis together including advancing tuberculosis research there is a strong foundation on which this work is building between 2000 and 2016 tuberculosis treatment alone saved 53 million lives including those of people with hiv however there are profound weaknesses that inhibit acceleration of these movements weak health systems are still far from providing universal coverage without financial hardship for high quality services including use of new tools for tuberculosis care and more urgently for multidrug resistant tuberculosis leaving more than a third of all tuberculosis cases unreported there is a dearth of innovative approaches that enable reaching the high risk groups and susceptible populations there is also a paucity of new and better tools for tuberculosis care and prevention point of care diagnostics new drugs shorter and better treatment regimens and safe and effective tuberculosis vaccines finally there is no truly multisectoral tuberculosis response which is essential to address the drivers and determinants of the epidemic the latest global burden of disease assessment measuring progress on health related sdgs concludes that tuberculosis is one of the health challenges for which dramatic acceleration of progress is most needed such urgent acceleration of efforts and investments is possible considering recent changes in global political economy half of the countries with high tuberculosis incidence that were classified as low income in 2000 are now in the middle income category and more countries are expected to join by 2020 the five brics countries bear about 45 of the worlds burden of tuberculosis and more than 60 of the multidrug resistant tuberculosis burden brics and other middle income countries with growing economies could ensure that domestic resources are mobilised and sustained to finance their responses to tuberculosis ending the global tuberculosis epidemic also requires parallel and substantial progress on healthrelated and other sdgs within the health related sdg3 targets universal health coverage and controlling the epidemics of hiv diabetes alcohol use disorders and tobacco smoking need to be addressed the drivers and determinants of the tuberculosis epidemic and the direct risk factors for tuberculosis will however need action on other non health related sdgs these include addressing poverty and social protection sdg1 hunger sdg2 indoor air pollution sdg7 working and living conditions sdg8 inequalities sdg10 lancet glob health 2017 author,Political Science

abstract stochastic actor based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences and test corresponding hypotheses the nodes in the network represent social actors and the collection of ties represents a social relation the assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process driven by the actors i e the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties the probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined i e as a function of the current network structure itself and in part exogenously as a function of characteristics of the nodes actor covariates and of characteristics of pairs of nodes dyadic covariates in an extended form stochastic actor based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors dynamics of networks and behavior this paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor based models for dynamics of directed networks using only a minimum of mathematics the focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model understanding the results and on sensible rules for model selection author,Political Science

this paper investigates age variations in foreign born vs native born mortality ratios in an international comparative perspective with the purpose of gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying the so called migrant mortality advantage we examine the four main explanations that have been proposed in the literature for the migrant mortality advantage i e in migration selection effects out migration selection effects cultural effects and data artifacts and formulate expectations as to whether they should generate an increase a decrease or no change in relative mortality over the life course using data from france the us and the uk for periods around 2010 we then examine typical age patterns of foreign born vs native born mortality ratios in light of this theoretical framework we find that these mortality ratios vary greatly by age with important similarities across migrant groups and host countries the most systematic age pattern we find is a u shape pattern at the aggregate level migrants often experience excess mortality at young ages then exhibit a large advantage at adult ages with the largest advantage around age 45 and finally experience mortality convergence with natives at older ages the explanation most consistent with this pattern is the in migration selection effects explanation by contrast the out migration selection effects explanation is poorly supported by the observed patterns our age disaggregation also shows that migrants at mid adult ages experience mortality advantages that are often far greater than typically documented in this literature overall these results reinforce the notion that migrants are a highly selected population exhibiting mortality patterns that poorly reflect their living conditions in host countries author,Political Science

introduction and method nafrica is currently host to a number of international genomics research and biobanking consortia each with a mandate to advance genomics research and biobanking in africa whilst most of these consortia promise to transform the way international health research is done in africa few have articulated exactly how they propose to go about this in this paper we report on a qualitative interviewing study in which we involved 17 genomics researchers in africa we describe their perceptions and expectations of international genomics research and biobanking initiatives in africa n n nresults nall interviewees were of the view that externally funded genomics research and biobanking initiatives in africa have played a critical role in building capacity for genomics research and biobanking in africa and in providing an opportunity for researchers in africa to collaborate and network with other researchers whilst the opportunity to collaborate was seen as a benefit some interviewees stressed the importance of recognizing that these collaborations carry mutual benefits for all partners including their collaborators in hics they also voiced two major concerns of being part of these collaborative initiatives the possibility of exploitation of african researchers and the non sustainability of research capacity building efforts as a way of minimising exploitation researchers in africa recommended that genuine efforts be made to create transparent and equitable international health research partnerships they suggested that this could be achieved through having rules of engagement enabling african researchers to contribute to the design and conduct of international health projects in africa and mutual and respectful exchange of experience and capacity between research collaborators these were identified as hallmarks to equitable international health research collaborations in africa n n nconclusion ngenomics research and biobanking initiatives in africa such as h3africa have gone some way in defining aspects of fair and equitable research collaborations in africa however they will need to strive at achieving equitable health research collaborations if they truly aim at setting a gold standard for how international health research should be conducted in africa author,Political Science

background nnational licensing examinations nles are large scale examinations usually taken by medical doctors close to the point of graduation from medical school where nles are used success is usually required to obtain a license for full practice approaches to national licensing and the evidence that supports their use varies significantly across the globe this paper aims to develop a typology of nles based on candidacy to explore the implications of different examination types for workforce planning n n nmethods na systematic review of the published literature and medical licensing body websites an electronic survey of all medical licensing bodies in highly developed nations and a survey of medical regulators n n nresults nthe evidence gleaned through this systematic review highlights four approaches to nles where graduating medical students wishing to practice in their national jurisdiction must pass a national licensing exam before they are granted a license to practice where all prospective doctors whether from the national jurisdiction or international medical graduates are required to pass a national licensing exam in order to practice within that jurisdiction where international medical graduates are required to pass a licensing exam if their qualifications are not acknowledged to be comparable with those students from the national jurisdiction and where there are no nles in operation this typology facilitates comparison across systems and highlights the implications of different licensing systems for workforce planning n n nconclusion nthe issue of national licensing cannot be viewed in isolation from workforce planning future research on the efficacy of national licensing systems to drive up standards should be integrated with research on the implications of such systems for the mobility of doctors to cross borders author,Political Science

between 1948 and 1960 south india madras state and southeast asia emerged as global centres for tuberculosis control this article attempts to situate tuberculosis control of these two regions within the broader context of international health it investigates the unique ways in which tuberculosis control in madras state reflected the inner tensions between the notional magic bullet approach which focuses on specific cures to root out the cause of the disease and a more holistic approach that relates disease prevention to overall well being of the population the implementation of tuberculosis control across south india and southeast asia shed light on the nature of the post colonial state sovereignty in public health across india as in southeast asia the state sovereignty appertaining to the implementation of health policy was fractured as evident in the opposition to the bacillus calmette gurin bcg vaccination based on a wide range of archival materials this article examines tuberculosis control in south india and southeast asia between 1948 and 1960 it situates tuberculosis control within the context of nationalist discourse and preventive medicine in doing so it adds not only to the historiography of tuberculosis in non western contexts which has hitherto focused on india sri lanka africa or the caribbean but also to the relatively new field of southeast asian medical history author,Political Science

in social epidemiology to speak of theory is simultaneously to speak of society and biology it is i will argue to speak of embodiment at issue is how we literally incorporate biologically the world around us a world in which we simultaneously are but one biological species among manyand one whose labour and ideas literally have transformed the face of this earth to conceptualize and elucidate the myriad social and biological processes resulting in embodiment and its manifestation in populations epidemiological profiles we need theory this is because theory helps us structure our ideas so as to explain causal connections between specified phenomena within and across specified domains by using interrelated sets of ideas whose plausibility can be tested by human action and thought 13 grappling with notions of causation in turn raises not only complex philosophical issues but also in the case of social epidemiology issues of accountability and agency simply invoking abstract notions of society and disembodied genes will not suffice instead the central question becomes who and what is responsible for population patterns of health disease and well being as manifested in present past and changing social inequalities in health author,Political Science

in an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace people must be able to make well informed financial decisions yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in germany the netherlands sweden japan italy new zealand and the united states or when they are changing rapidly as in russia further across these countries we show that the older population believes itself well informed even though it is actually less well informed than average other common patterns are also evident women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall more educated people are more informed yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy there are also ethnic racial and regional differences city dwellers in russia are better informed than their rural counterparts while in the u s african americans and hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others moreover the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement in fact answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3 4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as germany the u s japan and sweden in the netherlands it boosts planning by 10 percentage points finally using instrumental variables we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning in sum around the world financial literacy is critical to retirement security author,Political Science

this article describes the growth and consequences of new intellectual property rights given to pharmaceutical developers and it advocates treating clinical trials as a public good although the soaring cost of clinical trials is well known and discussed too little attention is given to the underlying rationale for allowing drug developers to recoup their costs through the new intellectual property rights provided in multilateral regional and bilateral agreements known in the us as market exclusivity and in europe as data exclusivity these rights prohibit would be generic producers from obtaining regulatory approval based on the original producers undisclosed test data market and data exclusivity is codified in us and european domestic law as well as the north american free trade agreement nafta and to a lesser degree the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips market and data exclusivity is binding an increasing number of developing countries via free trade agreements ftas which hinder developing countries from manufacturing generic drugs at a minimum negotiators should replace the norm of exclusive control over data with a liability rule or take and pay rule in which generic manufacturers can use original manufacturers clinical trial data in exchange for reasonable compensation a more fundamental solution requires questioning the status quo of proprietary clinical trial data the conventional wisdom is that market and data exclusivity and drug developers consequent ability to limit competition from generics above and beyond patent protection are a necessary incentive for drug developers to fund ever more expensive clinical trials clinical trial data however are public goods that will be undersupplied and over protected so long as private actors provide them moreover manufacturers have an incentive to present clinical trial data so that they support regulatory approval at the expense of public health although liability rules are better than the status quo they would not resolve the problem of treating a public good as proprietary governments should thus oversee and fund clinical trials as the public good that they are clinical tests should be awarded to the most qualified scientists through a competitive process financed in part with the decrease in drug costs to governmental health care programs and in part with drug developers contributions selected to maximize social benefit and made global via intergovernmental bodies to maximize social return this would reduce the cost of redundant investigations to the global public health system lower supply costs to drug consumers and lower the breakeven point for investment in research to discover new drugs author,Political Science

previous research on the determinants of effectiveness in knowledge systems seeking to support sustainable development has highlighted the importance of boundary work through which research communities organize their relations with new science other sources of knowledge and the worlds of action and policymaking a growing body of scholarship postulates specific attributes of boundary work that promote used and useful research these propositions however are largely based on the experience of a few industrialized countries we report here on an effort to evaluate their relevance for efforts to harness science in support of sustainability in the developing world we carried out a multicountry comparative analysis of natural resource management programs conducted under the auspices of the consultative group on international agricultural research we discovered six distinctive kinds of boundary work contributing to the successes of those programs a greater variety than has been documented in previous studies we argue that these different kinds of boundary work can be understood as a dual response to the different uses for which the results of specific research programs are intended and the different sources of knowledge drawn on by those programs we show that these distinctive kinds of boundary work require distinctive strategies to organize them effectively especially important are arrangements regarding participation of stakeholders accountability in governance and the use of boundary objects we conclude that improving the ability of research programs to produce useful knowledge for sustainable development will require both greater and differentiated support for multiple forms of boundary work author,Political Science

cooperation is central to human social behaviour however choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal cost to benefit others here we explore the cognitive basis of cooperative decision making in humans using a dual process framework we ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness behaving cooperatively only through active self control or whether they are intuitively cooperative with reflection and prospective reasoning favouring rational self interest to investigate this issue we perform ten studies using economic games we find that across a range of experimental designs subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative furthermore forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions finally an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection to explain these results we propose that cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is typically advantageous we then validate predictions generated by this proposed mechanism our results provide convergent evidence that intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas and that reflection can undermine these cooperative impulses author,Political Science

in an effort to address climate change many cities have joined the international council for local environmental initiatives iclei whose members commit to work toward five specific program objectives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this study examines the extent to which 257 member cities in the us have been successful in achieving these program milestones and identifies factors that may explain variation in the performance of member cities potential influences on milestone attainment include socioeconomic political and ideological characteristics of residents length of iclei membership existence of other climate programs within the state and local environmental pressures multiple regression results indicate that length of membership is the strongest predictor of milestone attainment regardless of local socioeconomic conditions ideological and political orientations of residents or other climate related initiatives within the state this finding supports the general effectiveness of iclei s network organizational model and its outreach and education efforts however member cities facing more climate stress including higher levels of hazardous air pollutants hap s and greater automobile use among residents are making slower progress the findings yield insight into the conditions under which cities engaged in climate planning are more likely to succeed in reducing local greenhouse gas emissions relevant information for planners community stakeholders and administrators of organizations like iclei author,Political Science
the great importance international rankings have in the research policy arena calls for caution as they present many flaws and shortcomings one of them has to do with the inability to accurately represent national university systems as their original purpose is only to rank world class universities another one has to do with the lack of representativeness of universities disciplinary profiles as they usually provide a unique table although some rankings offer a great coverage and others offer league tables by fields no international ranking does both in order to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint this paper analyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement international rankings for this we describe the spanish university system as a study case presenting the i ugr rankings for spanish universities by fields and subfields then we compare their results with those obtained by the shanghai ranking the qs ranking and the ntu ranking as they all have basic common grounds which allow such comparison we conclude that it is advisable to use national rankings in order to complement international rankings however we observe that this must be done with certain caution as they differ on the methodology employed as well as on the construction of the fields author,Political Science
international environmental regimes are considered key factors in dealing with global environmental change problems it is important to understand if and how regimes are effective in tackling these problems which requires knowledge on their potential impact on these problems as well as on their political feasibility integrated assessments of global environmental change which are mainly bio physical and technology economic oriented barely address knowledge on environmental regimes due to problems in drawing general and policy relevant lessons on regime effectiveness and inherent difficulties in modelling human and social dimensions this paper presents an innovative approach to formalize knowledge on the effectiveness of environmental regimes so that scientists from both the political science and integrated assessment domain can understand it discuss it and contribute to it we constructed a conceptual framework for the systematic analysis of conditions that influence regime effectiveness and implemented it in a computer model using fuzzy logic methodology we evaluated the fuzzy model in an ex post case study on four existing international environmental regimes the model can be used as an aid in analysing the effectiveness of existing or future regimes highlighting which determinants contribute to success or failure and it enables systematic and meaningful comparisons between regimes and policy measures we discovered that formalizing knowledge on environmental regimes in a framework and model enhanced its transparency and deductive power as it forced us to be explicit about our choices and assumptions developing and using the framework and model also revealed the lacunae in knowledge in environmental regime theory which may inform regime researchers to further structure and increase their knowledge by making knowledge on environmental regimes explicit and understandable we have taken an important step towards a better integration of political science in integrated assessments we believe however that this integration is still in its early days and requires further attention in the future author,Political Science

this paper provides strong evidence challenging the self interest assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking the evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate if treated fairly and to punish noncooperators we call this behavioral propensity strong reciprocity and show empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which purely self interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of cooperation in addition we show that people are willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a prisoners dilemma game with a third person this suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms involving for example food sharing or collective action strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation in other words kin selection reciprocal altruism indirect reciprocity and costly signaling theory however multilevel selection theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity author,Political Science

the aim of this work is to introduce some notions of commitment as a descriptive ontology crucial for the understanding of groups and organizations functioning and of the relations between individual agents and collective activity some of the basic ingredients of such notions are identified and some steps are made towards their definition in particular it is claimed that a notion of commitment is needed as a mediation between the individual and the collective one before constructing a notion of collective or group commitment a notion of social commitment is to be defined social commitment is not an individual commitment shared by many agents it is the commitment of one agent to another the normative contents entitlements obligations of this social relation are stressed and its connections with individual intentions and collective activity are alalized on that basis a notion of organizational commitment is proposed that could account for the structure of stable organizations commitment is a crucial notion both to analyse the structure of organizations and to support cooperative work but a deepex analysis is needed connecting agents mental states with social relations and structure author,Political Science

informal verbal interaction is the core matrix for human social life a mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of interaction is a system of turn taking that regulates who is to speak and when yet relatively little is known about how this system varies across cultures the anthropological literature reports significant cultural differences in the timing of turn taking in ordinary conversation we test these claims and show that in fact there are striking universals in the underlying pattern of response latency in conversation using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from traditional indigenous communities to major world languages we show that all of the languages tested provide clear evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a minimization of silence between conversational turns in addition all of the languages show the same factors explaining within language variation in speed of response we do however find differences across the languages in the average gap between turns within a range of 250 ms from the cross language mean we believe that a natural sensitivity to these tempo differences leads to a subjective perception of dramatic or even fundamental differences as offered in ethnographic reports of conversational style our empirical evidence suggests robust human universals in this domain where local variations are quantitative only pointing to a single shared infrastructure for language use with likely ethological foundations author,Political Science

large scale societies in which strangers regularly engage in mutually beneficial transactions are puzzling the evolutionary mechanisms associated with kinship and reciprocity which underpin much of primate sociality do not readily extend to large unrelated groups theory suggests that the evolution of such societies may have required norms and institutions that sustain fairness in ephemeral exchanges if that is true then engagement in larger scale institutions such as markets and world religions should be associated with greater fairness and larger communities should punish unfairness more using three behavioral experiments administered across 15 diverse populations we show that market integration measured as the percentage of purchased calories positively covaries with fairness while community size positively covaries with punishment participation in a world religion is associated with fairness although not across all measures these results suggest that modern prosociality is not solely the product of an innate psychology but also reflects norms and institutions that have emerged over the course of human history author,Political Science

co management or the joint management of the commons is often formulated in terms of some arrangement of power sharing between the state and a community of resource users in reality there often are multiple local interests and multiple government agencies at play and co management can hardly be understood as the interaction of a unitary state and a homogeneous community an approach focusing on the legal aspects of co management and emphasizing the formal structure of arrangements how governance is configured runs the risk of neglecting the functional side of co management an alternative approach is to start from the assumption that co management is a continuous problem solving process rather than a fixed state involving extensive deliberation negotiation and joint learning within problem solving networks this presumption implies that co management research should preferably focus on how different management tasks are organized and distributed concentrating on the function rather than the structure of the system such an approach has the effect of highlighting that power sharing is the result and not the starting point of the process this kind of research approach might employ the steps of 1 defining the social ecological system under focus 2 mapping the essential management tasks and problems to be solved 3 clarifying the participants in the problem solving processes 4 analyzing linkages in the system in particular across levels of organization and across geographical space 5 evaluating capacity building needs for enhancing the skills and capabilities of people and institutions at various levels and 6 prescribing ways to improve policy making and problem solving author,Political Science

n a government s international migration policies are intended to influence the size composition direction destination or integration of international migratory flows the justification for migratory policies has been based on a series of themes that have had varied weights in different stages of latin american history migrations as population settlement the desired or undesired characteristics of migrants the economic impact of migration the role of migration in relations between countries and the ethical dimensions of migratory movement have been the major policy issues the 1st migration policies in latin america saw international migration as a means of settling the colonies after independence migratory policies oriented toward massive settlement became common although the stated goals were to settle entire territories with immigrants the usual result was to absorb immigrants in certain economic sectors with high demand for labor in the colonial period both spain and portugal attempted to restrict immigration to the catholic segment of their own populations after independence the criteria were liberalized somewhat but still reflected prejudices about the racial superiority of certain types of european immigration the selection principals which appeared most clearly during the 19th century were overwhelmed to the extent that immigration was tranformed into provision of labor to meet unsatisfied needs for workers indiscriminate admissions and recourse to nontraditional elements such as chinese and japanese was strongest in countries needing labor for tropical agriculture or extractive industries the economic argument that migration contributed to development was widespread economic argument that migration contributed to development was widespread in the 19th and early 20th centuries but new rules were made to restrict immigration to protect local labor markets during the worldwide depression of the 1930s in recent decades migration policies have been seen as an element of international relations and regional integration the theme of human rights of immigrants including free circulation and settlement and equality of treatment for foreigners has assumed greater importance with the democratization of latin american countries and as a result of pressure from the international community the catholic church and labor organizations the principal argument for restriction of immigration in the past 4 decades has stemmed from a desire to limit immigration from bordering countries to protect local labor markets the masses of undocumented immigrants periodically legalized by special means suggest that migratory policies have yielded meager results global economic realities and national labor markets have had far more influence on migration flows than most administrative measures yet devised n author,Political Science

in october 1988 a global gathering of women met in new york city to speak against the trafficking in women worldwide it was especially significant that this international conference featured a section on women used in systems of surrogacysignificant for several reasons first of all the conference is the first womens gathering to locate surrogacy within the context of the international traffic in women thus surrogacy is defined as the buying and selling of women who are traded as commodities and rented uteruses for purposes of breeding many people have opposed surrogacy because they see it as baby selling for example the opposition to commercialized surrogacy in countries such as england and australia has been primarily based on the harm done to children not to women proposals to regulate or ban surrogacy in the united states whether federal or state have by and large focused on surrogacy as commercialized childbearing the core of the new jersey supreme court ruling in the matter of baby m centered on baby selling best interests of the child adoption laws and custody but children are not always born of surrogate arrangements women are always used in systems of surrogacy second within the united states particularly many liberals and liberal feminists have defended surrogacy as a womans reproductive right a womans right to choose a womans right to control her own body and do with it what she wills and as an economic option for women these are similar to the arguments that liberals and liberal feminists have advanced for legalizing prostitution therefore locating surrogacy within the context of an international conference against all forms of trafficking in womens bodies helps clarify the ways in which these liberal defenses of surrogacy are hollow and do nothing to enhance the dignity autonomy and civil rights of women worldwide in reality they do just the opposite we have here a colonized view of womens rights one that in the name of womens freedom buttresses womens reproductive servitude as orwell predicted freedom is slavery third surrogacy has been discussed by feminists and others within the context of the new reproductive technologies although surrogacy by itself is not really a technology and can be done by using a turkey baster artificial insemination process medicalized surrogate arrangements are increasingly being used with other new reproductive technologies such as ivf sex predetermination and embryo transfer thus a discussion of surrogacy within these technological parameters is perfectly appropriate just as important however is moving the discussion of surrogacy into the area of the international traffic in women this spotlights the international dimensions of surrogate arrangements and the international connections that feminists author,Political Science

international cooperation in life sciences as in any other of the space research fields takes place at two distinct levels scientist to scientist or agency to agency this article is more concerned with the agency to agency level which involves the arrangements made between two partners for the flying of experiments and or hardware on space missions international cooperation is inherent to the european space agency esa since it consists of 13 member states austria belgium denmark france ireland italy the netherlands norway spain sweden switzerland united kingdom and west germany and one associated member finland esa also has special cooperative arrangements with canada life sciences research in esa is carried out within the microgravity research program an optional program to which member states in this case all but austria and ireland contribute a la carte and receive their share accordingly therefore many of the activities are naturally linked to international arrangements within the member states and also to arrangements between the agencies with life sciences being the dominant activity between nasa and esa author,Political Science

effective climate mitigation requires international cooperation and these global efforts need broad public support to be sustainable over the long run we provide estimates of public support for different types of climate agreements in france germany the united kingdom and the united states using data from a large scale experimental survey we explore how three key dimensions of global climate cooperation costs and distribution participation and enforcement affect individuals willingness to support these international efforts we find that design features have significant effects on public support specifically our results indicate that support is higher for global climate agreements that involve lower costs distribute costs according to prominent fairness principles encompass more countries and include a small sanction if a country fails to meet its emissions reduction targets in contrast to well documented baseline differences in public support for climate mitigation efforts opinion responds similarly to changes in climate policy design in all four countries we also find that the effects of institutional design features can bring about decisive changes in the level of public support for a global climate agreement moreover the results appear consistent with the view that the sensitivity of public support to design features reflects underlying norms of reciprocity and individuals beliefs about the potential effectiveness of specific agreements author,Political Science
backgroundsex and gender differences are often overlooked in research design study implementation and scientific reporting as well as in general science communication this oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice in particular for women but also for men this article describes the rationale for an international set of guidelines to encourage a more systematic approach to the reporting of sex and gender in research across disciplines methodsa panel of 13 experts representing nine countries developed the guidelines through a series of teleconferences conference presentations and a 2 day workshop an internet survey of 716 journal editors scientists and other members of the international publishing community was conducted as well as a literature search on sex and gender policies in scientific publishing resultsthe sex and gender equity in research sager guidelines are a comprehensive procedure for reporting of sex and gender information in study design data analyses results and interpretation of findings conclusionsthe sager guidelines are designed primarily to guide authors in preparing their manuscripts but they are also useful for editors as gatekeepers of science to integrate assessment of sex and gender into all manuscripts as an integral part of the editorial process author,Political Science
how does uncertainty about dangerous climate change affect the prospects for international cooperation climate negotiations usually are depicted as a prisoners dilemma game collectively countries are better off reducing their emissions but self interest impels them to keep on emitting we provide experimental evidence grounded in an analytical framework showing that the fear of crossing a dangerous threshold can turn climate negotiations into a coordination game making collective action to avoid a dangerous threshold virtually assured these results are robust to uncertainty about the impact of crossing a threshold but uncertainty about the location of the threshold turns the game back into a prisoners dilemma causing cooperation to collapse our research explains the paradox of why countries would agree to a collective goal aimed at reducing the risk of catastrophe but act as if they were blind to this risk author,Political Science

this article examines the rise in co authorship in the social sciences over a 34 year period it investigates the development in co authorship in different research fields and discusses how the methodological differences in these research fields together with changes in academia affect the tendency to co author articles the study is based on bibliographic data about 4 5million peer review articles published in the period 19802013 and indexed in the 56 subject categories of the web of sciences social science citation index the results show a rise in the average number of authors share of co authored and international co authored articles in the majority of the subject categories however the results also show that there are great disciplinary differences to the extent of the rises in co authorship the subject categories with a great share of international co authored articles have generally experienced an increase in co authorship but increasing international collaboration is not the only factor influencing the rise in co authorship hence the most substantial rises have occurred in subject categories where the research often is based on the use of experiments large data set statistical methods and or team production models author,Political Science

there is currently widespread public misunderstanding about the degree of scientific consensus on human caused climate change both in the us as well as internationally moreover previous research has identified important associations between public perceptions of the scientific consensus belief in climate change and support for climate policy this paper extends this line of research by advancing and providing experimental evidence for a gateway belief model gbm using national data n 1104 from a consensus message experiment we find that increasing public perceptions of the scientific consensus is significantly and causally associated with an increase in the belief that climate change is happening human caused and a worrisome threat in turn changes in these key beliefs are predictive of increased support for public action in short we find that perceived scientific agreement is an important gateway belief ultimately influencing public responses to climate change author,Political Science

nuclear safeguards have been an essential part of the global order since the beginnings of the nuclear age the international atomic energy agency iaea an international bureaucracy that is supposed to be a non political technical institution administers this global nuclear safeguards regime even though safeguards have always been controversial they have turned out to be the most enduring item in the international community s toolbox to prevent or slow down the spread of nuclear weapons to non nuclear states this analysis shows that nuclear safeguards whilst they survived the fall of the iron curtain were a genuine invention of the cold war at the beginning of the nuclear age there was an overall understanding that safeguards were not strong enough to prevent the global spread of nuclear weapons it was only over the course of the late 1950s and 1960s that safeguards moved from the margins to the centre of diplomatic negotiations about global nuclear order newly declassified records from the iaea archives in vienna offer insights into the evolution of early nuclear safeguards and suggest that negotiation patterns proceedings and settings affected the outcome of this nuclear diplomacy author,Political Science
collaboration among scientists has a major influence on scientific progress such collaboration often results from scientific meetings where scientists gather to present and discuss their research and to meet potential collaborators however most scientific meetings have inherent biases such as the availability of research funding or the selection bias of professional societies that make it difficult to study the effect of the meeting per se on scientific productivity to evaluate the effects of scientific meetings on collaboration and progress independent of these biases we conducted a study of the annual symposia held by the international milk genomics consortium imgc over a 12 year period in our study we conducted permutation testing to analyze the effectiveness of the imgc in facilitating collaboration and productivity in a community of milk scientists who were meeting attendees relative to non attendees using the number of co authorships on published papers as a measure of collaboration our analysis revealed that scientists who attended the symposium were associated with more collaboration than were scientists who did not attend furthermore we evaluated the scientific progress of consortium attendees by analyzing publication rate and article impact we found that imgc attendees in addition to being more collaborative were also more productive and influential than were non attendees who published in the same field the results of our study suggest that the annual symposium encouraged interactions among disparate scientists and increased research productivity exemplifying the positive effect of scientific meetings on both collaboration and progress author,Political Science

international research collaboration plays an important role in the social construction and evolution of science studies of science increasingly analyze international collaboration across multiple organizations for its impetus in improving research quality advancing efficiency of the scientific production and fostering breakthroughs in a shorter time however long run patterns of international research collaboration across scientific fields and their structural changes over time are hardly known here we show the convergence of international scientific collaboration across research fields over time our study uses a dataset by the national science foundation and computes the fraction of papers that have international institutional coauthorships for various fields of science we compare our results with pioneering studies carried out in the 1970s and 1990s by applying a standardization method that transforms all fractions of internationally coauthored papers into a comparable framework we find over 1973 2012 that the evolution of collaboration patterns across scientific disciplines seems to generate a convergence between applied and basic sciences we also show that the general architecture of international scientific collaboration based on the ranking of fractions of international coauthorships for different scientific fields per year has tended to be unchanged over time at least until now overall this study shows to our knowledge for the first time the evolution of the patterns of international scientific collaboration starting from initial results described by literature in the 1970s and 1990s we find a convergence of these long run collaboration patterns between the applied and basic sciences this convergence might be one of contributing factors that supports the evolution of modern scientific fields author,Political Science

the goal of this commentary is to articulate some issues and dilemmas raised by various efforts to mobilize international action around child abuse and neglect can we will start by proposing a typology of international mobilization strategies noting that initiatives to promote can programming in new settings have tended to emphasize one of three vectors governments professionals or international ngos there are pros and cons to each emphasis which we discuss we also review the debates around some of the following dilemmas should low income countries be a top priority for can mobilization are there cultural and institutional capacities that need to be present in a country in order for can programs to work or be ethical are some can programs more likely to be internationally transferable than others and why so has the field adequately considered whether non can programming e g family planning might actually be more effective at preventing maltreatment than can programming does the field give adequate acknowledgment that policies and practices emanating from high resourced and western countries may not always be the best to disseminate are we relying too much on a model of program transplantation over a model of local cultivation should we aim for modest rather than ambitious accomplishments in international mobilization how much emphasis should be placed on the priority dissemination of evidence based programming we conclude with some suggestions in the service of clarifying these dilemmas and making some of these decisions more evidence based author,Political Science

abstractreliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings the main measures of reliability are within subject random variation systematic change in the mean and retest correlation a simple adaptable form of within subject variation is the typical standard error of measurement the standard deviation of an individuals repeated measurements for many measurements in sports medicine and science the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation percentage of the mean a biased more limited form of within subject variation is the limits of agreement the 95 likely range of change of an individuals measurements between 2 trials systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning motivation or fatigue these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within subject variation retest correlation is difficult to interpret mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants uses of reliability include decision making when monitoring individuals comparison of tests or equipment estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly a wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines n author,Medicine

the methodology for studies designed to investigate potential risk factors for sports injury is reviewed using the case of hamstring strains as an example injuries result from a complex interaction of multiple risk factors and events therefore a multivariate statistical approach should be used in addition the sample size of the study needs to be considered carefully sample size mainly depends on the expected effect of the risk factor on injury risk and to detect moderate to strong associations 20 50 injury cases are needed whereas small to moderate associations would need about 200 injured subjects studies published to date on the risk factors for hamstring strains have methodological limitations and are too small to detect small to moderate associations author,Medicine

athletes are among the groups of people who are interested in the effects of caffeine on endurance and exercise capacity although many studies have investigated the effect of caffeine ingestion on exercise not all are suited to draw conclusions regarding caffeine and sports performance characteristics of studies that can better explore the issues of athletes include the use of well trained subjects conditions that reflect actual practices in sport and exercise protocols that simulate real life events there is a scarcity of field based studies and investigations involving elite performers researchers are encouraged to use statistical analyses that consider the magnitude of changes and to establish whether these are meaningful to the outcome of sport the available literature that follows such guidelines suggests that performance benefits can be seen with moderate amounts 3 mg kg 1 body mass of caffeine furthermore these benefits are likely to occur across a range of sports including endurance events stop and go events e g team and racquet sports and sports involving sustained high intensity activity lasting from 1 60 min e g swimming rowing and middle and distance running races the direct effects on single events involving strength and power such as lifts throws and sprints are unclear further studies are needed to better elucidate the range of protocols timing and amount of doses that produce benefits and the range of sports to which these may apply individual responses the politics of sport and the effects of caffeine on other goals such as sleep hydration and refuelling also need to be considered author,Medicine
children and adolescents with medical conditions present special issues with respect to participation in athletic activities the pediatrician can play an important role in determining whether a child with a health condition should participate in certain sports by assessing the child s health status suggesting appropriate equipment or modifications of sports to decrease the risk of injury and educating the athlete parent s or guardian and coach regarding the risks of injury as they relate to the child s condition this report updates a previous policy statement and provides information for pediatricians on sports participation for children and adolescents with medical conditions author,Medicine
for many sporting activities initial speed rather than maximal speed would be considered of greater importance to successful performance the purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between strength and power and measures of first step quickness 5 m time acceleration 10 m time and maximal speed 30 m time the maximal strength 3 repetition maximum 3rm power 30 kg jump squat countermovement and drop jumps isokinetic strength measures hamstring and quadriceps peak torques and ratios at 60 degrees s 1 and 300 degrees s 1 and 5 m 10 m and 30 m sprint times of 26 part time and full time professional rugby league players age 23 2 3 3 years were measured to examine the importance of the strength and power measures on sprint performance a correlational approach and a comparison between means of the fastest and slowest players was used the correlations between the 3rm drop jump isokinetic strength measures and the 3 measures of sport speed were nonsignificant correlations between the jump squat height and relative power output and countermovement jump height and the 3 speed measures were significant r 0 43 to 0 66 p lt 0 05 the squat and countermovement jump heights as well as squat jump relative power output were the only variables found to be significantly greater in the fast players it was suggested that improving the power to weight ratio as well as plyometric training involving countermovement and loaded jump squat training may be more effective for enhancing sport speed in elite players author,Medicine
self confidence sc is one of the most cited factors thought to affect athletic performance sc is said to playa critical role in athletes success in contrast lack ofsc seems to be closely associated with athletic failure thus confidence is an importantfactor that distinguishes successful athletes from unsuccessful ones in terms of both their mental states as well as their performances however the precise nature of sc was quite unclear until the publication of feltz s seminal chapter on this issue the term self confidence refers to one s belief that he or she can successfully execute a desired behavior i e his or her belief of t ii get the job done feltz argued that the exact relationships of sc and performance in sport have not been scientifically clarified in a satisfactory manner to promote our understanding of the precise nature of these relationships she first presented several definitions of sc and briefly discussed them with reference to some related terms such as perceived ability self concept self esteem and performance expectancies feltz presented three of the major theoretical approaches available at that time for studying these relationships bandura s self efficacy theory harter s perceived competence model and vealey s concept of sport confidence she not only described the theoretical approaches but also provided extensive research evidence in sport and reviewed some relevant criticisms feltz summarized and compared these three approaches and derived some important conclusions referring to the at that time updated scientific status of the relationships between sc and sport performance this seminal chapter did not of course completely resolve the riddle of sc in sport however feltz organized and presented the theoretical knowledge relevant to sc in sport at that time and undoubtedly had a profound influence on many researchers in this area which is theoretically intriguing and has a substantial practical importance for those actively involved in sport author,Medicine
summarynotwithstanding the healthy influence of sporting activities on risk factors in particular those of cardiovascular disease it is becoming increasingly apparent that sports can present a danger to health in the form of sports injuries the extent of the sports injury problem calls for preventative action based on the results of epidemiological research for the interpretation of these facts uniform definitions are needed and limitations of research designs should be known measures to prevent sports injuries form part of what is called the sequence of prevention firstly the extent of the sports injury problem must be identified and described secondly the factors and mechanisms which play a part in the occurrence of sports injuries have to be identified the third step is to introduce measures that are likely to reduce the future risk and or severity of sports injuries this measure should be based on the aetiological factors and the mechanism as identified in the second step finally the effect of the measures must be evaluated by repeating the first step in this review some aspects of the first and second step of the sequence of prevention are discussed the extent of the sports injury problem is often described by injury incidence and by indicators of the severity of sports injuries sports injury incidence should preferably be expressed as the number of sports injuries per exposure time e g per 1000 hours of sports participation in order to facilitate the comparability of research results however one should realise that the outcome of research applying this definition of sports injury incidence is highly dependent on the definitions of sports injury and sports participation the outcome of such research also depends on the applied research design and research methodology the incidence of sports injuries depends on the method used to count injuries e g prospective vs retrospective the method used to establish the population at risk and on the representativeness of the sample severity of sports injuries can be described on the basis of 6 criteria the nature of the sports injury the duration and nature of treatment sporting time lost working time lost permanent damage and cost here also uniform definitions are important and necessary in order to enhance the comparability of research data in the second step of the sequence of prevention the aetiological factors that play a role in the occurrence of a sports injury have to be identified by epidemiological studies epidemiological research on the aetiology of sports injuries requires a conceptual model the most commonly applied model is a stress capacity model in which internal personal and external environmental aetiological factors are identified in this model stress and capacity must be in balance and preventative measures must be designed to achieve or maintain this balance however merely to establish the aetiological factors is not enough the mechanism by which sports injuries occur must also be identified athletes are in constant interaction with their environment and aetiological factors must be approached from this point of view in a second more dynamic conceptual model on the aetiology of sports injuries the importance of the determinants of sports behaviour as well as the interaction between the various aetiological factors is discussed whether or not a sports injury results from sports behaviour largely depends on the extent to which prevention is incorporated in the determinants of sports behaviour the drawback of both conceptual models is the fact that neither of them incorporate a time perspective they can therefore not be applied to research on the aetiology of overuse injuries in this perspective the application of a stress strain capacity model can be useful this is a more dynamic and time based 3 phase sequential model in which behaviour amongst other aetiological factors plays an important role in this model an athlete is seen as an active manipulator of stress by whom the amount of strain evoked by sports participation can be altered thereby influencing the capacity to perform in a certain sports situation but also influencing the risk to sustain a sports injury either acute or long term finally despite the importance of the model of choice in studying the aetiology of sports injuries one should realise that again the choice of research design influences the outcome of such research case series usually give no information on the underlying population at risk so they are of no value in drawing valid conclusions on the risk factors of injuries only by relating the injuries to corresponding population denominators can one estimate injury rates and identify important risk factors and high risk sportspeople as in research on sports injury incidence research on risk factors should be undertaken on groups that are homogeneous with regard to age sex level of competition and type of sport author,Medicine
summarychronobiology is the science concerned with investigations of time dependent changes in physiological variables circadian rhythms refer to variations that recur every 24 hours many physiological circadian rhythms at rest are endogenously controlled and persist when an individual is isolated from environmental fluctuations unlike physiological variables human performance cannot be monitored continuously in order to describe circadian rhythmicity experimental studies of the effect of circadian rhythms on performance need to be carefully designed in order to control for serial fatigue effects and to minimise disturbances in sleep the detection of rhythmicity in performance variables is also highly influenced by the degree of test retest repeatability of the measuring equipment the majority of components of sports performance e g flexibility muscle strength short term high power output vary with time of day in a sinusoidal manner and peak in the early evening close to the daily maximum in body temperature psychological tests of short term memory heart rate based tests of physical fitness and prolonged submaximal exercise performance carried out in hot conditions show peak times in the morning heart rate based tests of work capacity appear to peak in the morning because the heart rate responses to exercise are minimal at this time of day post lunch declines are evident with performance variables such as muscle strength especially if measured frequently enough and sequentially within a 24 hour period to cause fatigue in individuals more research work is needed to ascertain whether performance in tasks demanding fine motor control varies with time of day metabolic and respiratory rhythms are flattened when exercise becomes strenuous whilst the body temperature rhythm persists during maximal exercise higher work rates are selected spontaneously in the early evening at present it is not known whether time of day influences the responses of a set training regimen one in which the training stimulus does not vary with time of day for endurance strength or the learning of motor skills the normal circadian rhythms can be desynchronised following a flight across several time zones or a transfer to nocturnal work shifts although athletes show all the symptoms of jet lag increased fatigue disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms more research work is needed to identify the effects of transmeridian travel on the actual performances of elite sports competitors such investigations would need to be chronobiological i e monitor performance at several dmes on several post flight days and take into account direction of travel time of day of competition and the various performance components involved in a particular sport shiftwork interferes with participation in competitive sport although there may be greater opportunities for shiftworkers to train in the hours of daylight for individual sports such as cycling and swimming studies should be conducted to ascertain whether shiftwork mediated rhythm disturbances affect sports performance individual differences in performance rhythms are small but significant circadian rhythms are larger in amplitude in physically fit individuals than sedentary individuals athletes over 50 years of age tend to be higher in momingness habitually scheduling relatively more training in the morning and selecting relatively higher work rates during exercise compared with young athletes these differences should be recognised by practitioners concerned with organising the habitual regimens of athletes author,Medicine
the use of cryotherapy i e the application of cold for the treatment of injury or disease is widespread in sports medicine today it is an established method when treating acute soft tissue injuries but there is a discrepancy between the scientific basis for cryotherapy and clinical studies various methods such as ice packs ice towels ice massage gel packs refrigerant gases and inflatable splints can be used cold is also used to reduce the recovery time as part of the rehabilitation programme both after acute injuries and in the treatment of chronic injuries cryotherapy has also been shown to reduce pain effectively in the post operative period after reconstructive surgery of the joints both superficial and deep temperature changes depend on the method of application initial temperature and application time the physiological and biological effects are due to the reduction in temperature in the various tissues together with the neuromuscular action and relaxation of the muscles produced by the application of cold cold increases the pain threshold the viscosity and the plastic deformation of the tissues but decreases the motor performance the application of cold has also been found to decrease the inflammatory reaction in an experimental situation cold appears to be effective and harmless and few complications or side effects after the use of cold therapy are reported prolonged application at very low temperatures should however be avoided as this may cause serious side effects such as frost bite and nerve injuries practical applications indications and contraindications are discussed author,Medicine
objective nthe consensus of opinion suggests that when assessing measurement agreement the most appropriate statistic to report is the 95 limits of agreement the precise form that this interval takes depends on whether a positive relation exists between the differences in measurement methods errors and the size of the measurements that is heteroscedastic errors if a positive and significant relation exists the recommended procedure is to report the ratio limits of agreement using log transformed measurements this study assessed the prevalence of heteroscedastic errors when investigating measurement agreement of variables recorded on a ratio scale in sports medicine and sports science n n nmethods nmeasurement agreement or repeatability was assessed in 13 studies providing 23 examples conducted in the centre for sport and exercise sciences at liverpool john moores university over the past five years n n nresults nthe correlation between the absolute differences and the mean was positive in all 23 examples median r 0 37 eight being significant p lt 0 05 in 21 of 23 examples analysed the correlation was greater than the equivalent correlation using log transformed measurements median r 0 01 based on a simple meta analysis the assumption that no relation exists between the measurement differences and the size of measurement must be rejected p lt 0 001 n n nconclusions nwhen assessing measurement agreement of variables recorded on a ratio scale in sports medicine and sports science this study 23 examples provides strong evidence that heteroscedastic errors are the norm if the correlation between the absolute measurement differences and the means is positive but not necessarily significant and greater than the equivalent correlation using log transformed measurements the authors recommend reporting the ratio limits of agreement author,Medicine

this article aims to examine pediatric concussion literature with respect to epidemiology etiology return to play and recurrent concussions and to provide recommendations for future research we conducted a review of pediatric concussion literature regarding incidence etiology return to play and recurrent concussive injury by using medline cinahl sport discus and psychinfo databases from 1995 2010 a review of reference lists in the aforementioned articles was also performed we discovered that the research on sports related concussion specific to children and adolescents is rather limited results of existing studies of concussion incidence in this population indicate that concussion is relatively rare compared with most musculoskeletal injuries however the potential consequences of mismanagement and of subsequent injury warrant significant attention regarding injury recognition and recovery and the challenge of determining readiness to return to play evidence exists that children and adolescents take longer to recover than adults after a concussion which underscores the need for a more conservative approach to management and return to physical and cognitive activities concussion in the young athlete is of specific concern because of the continuing cognitive maturation therefore the recovery may be more difficult to track when using the standard assessment tools currently available until future studies can better delineate the mechanisms of response to and recovery from concussion in the young athlete it is prudent to act in a conservative manner when dealing with pediatric athletes with concussion author,Medicine
this paper overviews the importance for sports biomechanics of movement variability which has been studied for some time by cognitive and ecological motor skills specialists but until quite recently had somewhat been overlooked by sports biomechanists the paper considers biomechanics research reporting inter and intra individual movement variability in javelin and discus throwing basketball shooting and locomotion the overview does not claim to be comprehensive and we exclude such issues as the theoretical background to movement and coordination variability and their measurement we overview evidence both theoretical and empirical of inter individual movement variability in seeking to achieve the same task goal in contrast to the concept of optimal movement patterns furthermore even elite athletes cannot reproduce identical movement patterns after many years of training contradicting the ideas of motor invariance and representative trials we contend that movement variability far from being solely due to neuromuscular system or measurement noise as sports biomechanists may have previously supposed is or could be functional such functionality could allow environmental adaptations reduce injury risk and facilitate changes in coordination patterns we conclude by recommending that sports biomechanists should focus more of their research on movement variability and on important related topics such as control and coordination of movement and implications for practice and skill learning author,Medicine
background nregular physical activity may have psychological benefits our study assessed the association between extent of participation in regular sport or vigorous recreational activity and emotional wellbeing in adolescents aged 16 years n n nmethods ndata were collected from a cohort of adolescents born between april 5 and april 11 1970 in england scotland and wales who took part in the follow up assessment at age 16 years emotional wellbeing was assessed by the general health questionnaire ghq and the malaise inventory divided into psychological and somatic subscales information was obtained about participation in ten team and 25 individual sports and vigorous recreational activities during the previous year non vigorous recreations such as darts and snooker were assessed separately social class and health status recent illness and use of hospital services were included in our analyses as possible confounding factors 2223 boys and 2838 girls with a mean age of 16 3 years sd 0 38 were included in our analysis statistical analysis was by multiple linear and logistic regression n n nfindings nthe sport and vigorous recreational activity index was positively associated with emotional wellbeing independently of sex social class health status and use of hospital services these associations were significant for the psychological symptom subscale of the malaise inventory regression coefficient 0 024 95 percent cl 0 036 to 0 011 p lt 0 001 and the ghq odds ratio of emotional distress per unit increase in vigorous physical activity 0 992 95 percent cl 0 985 0 998 p lt o o1 by contrast participation in non vigorous activities was associated with high psychological and somatic symptoms on the malaise inventory n n ninterpretation nwe conclude that emotional wellbeing is positively associated with extent of participation in sport and vigorous recreational activity among adolescents although causal associations cannot be assumed in this cross sectional analysis our results are consistent with experimental evidence that vigorous exercise has favourable effects on emotional state author,Medicine
the placebo effect with its central role in clinical trials is acknowledged as a factor in sports medicine although until recently little has been known about the likely magnitude and extent of the effect in any specific research setting even less is known about the prevalence of the effect in competitive sport the present paper reviews 12 intervention studies in sports performance all examine placebo effects associated with the administration of an inert substance believed by subjects to be an ergogenic aid placebo effects of varying magnitudes are reported in studies addressing sports from weightlifting to endurance cycling findings suggest that psychological variables such as motivation expectancy and conditioning and the interaction of these variables with physiological variables might be significant factors in driving both positive and negative outcomes programmatic research involving the triangulation of data and investigation of contextual and personality factors in the mediation of placebo responses may help to advance knowledge in this area author,Medicine

impact and underlying causes of circadian rhythmicity in sports performance we argue that there is a wealth of information from both applied and experimental work which when considered together suggests that sports performance is affected by time of day in normal entrained conditions and that the variation has at least some input from endogenous mechanisms nevertheless precise information on the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous factors is lacking no single study can answer both the applied and basic research questions that are relevant to this topic but an appropriate mixture of real world research on rhythm disturbances and tightly controlled experiments involving forced desynchronization protocols is needed important issues which should be considered by any chronobiologist interested in sports and exercise include how representative the study sample and the selected performance tests are test retest reliability as well as overall design of the experiment author,Medicine
this paper critically reviews technique analysis as an analytical method used within sports biomechanics as a part of performance analysis the concept of technique as a specific sequence of movements appears to be well established in the literature but the concept of technique analysis is less well developed although several descriptive and analytical goals for technique analysis can be identified the main justification given for its use is to aid in the improvement of performance however the conceptual framework underpinning this process is poorly developed with a lack of distinction between technique and performance the methods of technique analysis have been divided into qualitative quantitative and predictive components qualitative technique analysis is characterized by observation and subjective judgement several aids to observation are identified including phase analysis temporal analysis and critical feature analysis although biomechanical principles of movement can be used to form judgements about technique little agreement exists about the number and categories of these principles a deterministic model can be used to identify factors that affect performance but in doing so technique variables are frequently overlooked quantitative technique analysis relies on biomechanical data collection methods the identification of key technique variables that affect performance is a major issue but these are poorly distinguished from other variables that affect performance quantitative analysis is not suitable for establishing the characteristics of the whole skill but new methods such as the use of artificial neural networks are described that may be able to overcome this limitation other methods based on modelling and computer simulation also have potential for focusing on the whole skill predictive technique analysis encompasses these developments and offers an attractive interface between the scientist and coach through visual animation methods i conclude that biomechanists need to clarify the underpinning rationale framework and scope for the various approaches to technique analysis author,Medicine
daily requirements for protein are set by the amount of amino acids that is irreversibly lost in a given day different agencies have set requirement levels for daily protein intakes for the general population however the question of whether strength trained athletes require more protein than the general population is one that is difficult to answer at a cellular level an increased requirement for protein in strength trained athletes might arise due to the extra protein required to support muscle protein accretion through elevated protein synthesis alternatively an increased requirement for protein may come about in this group of athletes due to increased catabolic loss of amino acids associated with strength training activities a review of studies that have examined the protein requirements of strength trained athletes using nitrogen balance methodology has shown a modest increase in requirements in this group at the same time several studies have shown that strength training consistent with the anabolic stimulus for protein synthesis it provides actually increases the efficiency of use of protein which reduces dietary protein requirements various studies have shown that strength trained athletes habitually consume protein intakes higher than required a positive energy balance is required for anabolism so a requirement for extra protein over and above normal values also appears not to be a critical issue for competitive athletes because most would have to be in positive energy balance to compete effectively at present there is no evidence to suggest that supplements are required for optimal muscle growth or strength gain strength trained athletes should consume protein consistent with general population guidelines or 12 to 15 of energy from protein author,Medicine

summaryathletes reduce bodyweight for several reasons to compete in a lower weight class to improve aesthetic appearance or to increase physical performance rapid bodyweight reduction dehydration in 12 to 96 hours typically with fluid restriction and increased exercise is used by athletes competing in weight class events gradual bodyweight reduction over gt 1 week is usually achieved by cutting energy intake to 75 to 130 kj kg day an intake of 100 kj kg day results in a weekly bodyweight loss of roughly 1kg aerobic endurance capacity decreases after rapid bodyweight reduction but might increase after gradual bodyweight reduction maximal oxygen uptake vo2max measured as l min is unchanged or decreased after bodyweight loss but vo2max measured as ml kg min may increase after gradual bodyweight reduction anaerobic performance and muscle strength are typically decreased after rapid bodyweight reduction with or without 1 to 3 hours rehydration when tested after 5 to 24 hours of rehydration performance is maintained at euhydrated levels a high carbohydrate diet during bodyweight loss may help in maintaining performance anaerobic performance is not affected and strength can increase after gradual bodyweight reduction reductions in plasma volume muscle glycogen content and the buffer capacity of the blood explain decreased performance after rapid bodyweight reduction during gradual bodyweight loss slow glycogen resynthesis after training loss of muscle protein and stress fractures caused by endocrinological disorders may affect performance athletes bodyweight goals should be individualised rather than by comparing with other athletes if the time between weigh in and competition is lt 5 hours rapid bodyweight reduction should not exceed 4 of bodyweight if the time interval is longer a bodyweight reduction 8 might be acceptable a moderate energy 100 to 120 kj kg day and high carbohydrate 60 to 70 of total energy intake diet is recommended gradual bodyweight reduction may be 0 5 to 1 5 kg week energy intake should be 80 to 120 kj kg day with a high carbohydrate 60 to 70 and a low fat 15 to 25 content author,Medicine

this paper attempts to clarify the formulation of power equations applicable to a variety of endurance activities an accurate accounting of the relationship between the metabolic power input and the mechanical power output is still elusive due to such issues as storage and recovery of strain energy and the differing energy costs of concentric and eccentric muscle actions nevertheless an instantaneous approach is presented which is based upon the application of conventional newtonian mechanics to a rigid segment model of the body and does not contain assumptions regarding the exact nature of segmental interactions such as energy transfer etc the application of the equation to running cycling speed skating swimming and rowing is discussed and definitions of power efficiency and economy are presented author,Medicine
injuries can counter the beneficial effects of sports participation at a young age if a child or adolescent is unable to continue to participate because of residual effects of injury this paper reviews current knowledge in the field of long term health outcomes of youth sports injuries to evaluate the evidence regarding children dropping out of sport due to injury physeal injuries and growth disturbance studies of injuries affecting the spine and knee of young and former athletes and surgical outcome of anterior cruciate ligament acl reconstruction in children studies of dropping out of sport due to injury are limited primarily to gymnasts and implicate such injuries as acl rupture and osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow joint in the early retirement of young athletes although most physeal injuries resolve with treatment and rest there is evidence of disturbed physeal growth as a result of injury radiological findings implicate the effects of intense physical loading and injury in the development of spinal pathology and back pain during the growth of youth athletes however long term effects are unclear follow up studies of young athletes and adults indicate a high risk of osteoarthritis after meniscus or acl injury prospective cohort studies with a follow up into adulthood are needed to clarify the long term health outcomes of youth sports injuries important to this research is meticulous documentation of injuries on injury report forms that include age appropriate designations of the type of injury and accurate determination of exposure based injury rates author,Medicine
safety in sports and physical activity is an important prerequisite for continuing participation in sports as well as for maintenance of a healthy physically active lifestyle for this reason prevention reduction and control of sports injuries are important goals for society as a whole recent advances in sports medicine discuss the need for research on real life injury prevention such views call for a more behavioural approach when it comes to actual sports injury prevention nevertheless the role of behaviour in sports injury prevention remains under researched in order to push the field of sports injury prevention forward this article provides an overview of the relationship between behaviour and sports injury risk different types of behaviour relate to injury risk factors and injury mechanisms behaviour that influences risk factors and injury mechanisms is not confined only to the athlete various types of behaviour by for example the coach referee physical therapist or sports associations also influence risk factors and injury mechanisms in addition multiple behaviours often act together some types of behaviour may directly affect injury risk and are by definition a risk factor other behaviours may only affect risk factors and injury mechanisms and influence injury risk indirectly recent ideas on injury prevention that call for studies on real life injury prevention still rely heavily on preventive measures that are established through efficacy research a serious limitation in such an approach is that one expects that proven preventive measures will be adopted if the determinants and influences of sports safety behaviours are understood therefore if one truly wants to prevent sports injuries in a real life situation a broader research focus is needed in trying to do so we need to look at lessons learned from other fields of injury prevention research author,Medicine

traditional talent development pathways for adolescents in team sports follow talent identification procedures based on subjective games ratings and isolated athletic assessment most talent development models are exclusive rather than inclusive in nature subsequently talent identification may result in discontentment premature stratification or dropout from team sports understanding the multidimensional differences among the requirements of adolescent and elite adult athletes could provide more realistic goals for potential talented players coach education should include adolescent development and rewards for team success at the adolescent level should reflect the needs of long term player development effective talent development needs to incorporate physical and psychological maturity the relative age effect objective measures of game sense and athletic prowess the influences of media and culture on the individual and the competing time demands between various competitions for player training time should be monitored and mediated where appropriate despite the complexity talent development is a worthy investment in professional team sport author,Medicine
this paper summarizes the current understanding on acute ankle sprain injury which is the most common acute sport trauma accounting for about 14 of all sport related injuries among 80 are ligamentous sprains caused by explosive inversion or supination the injury motion often happens at the subtalar joint and tears the anterior talofibular ligament atfl which possesses the lowest ultimate load among the lateral ligaments at the ankle for extrinsic risk factors to ankle sprain injury prescribing orthosis decreases the risk while increased exercise intensity in soccer raises the risk for intrinsic factors a foot size with increased width an increased ankle eversion to inversion strength plantarflexion strength and ratio between dorsiflexion and plantarflexion strength and limb dominance could increase the ankle sprain injury risk players with a previous sprain history players wearing shoes with air cells players who do not stretch before exercising players with inferior single leg balance and overweight players are 4 9 4 3 2 6 2 4 and 3 9 times more likely to sustain an ankle sprain injury the aetiology of most ankle sprain injuries is incorrect foot positioning at landing a medially deviated vertical ground reaction force causes an explosive supination or inversion moment at the subtalar joint in a short time about 50 ms another aetiology is the delayed reaction time of the peroneal muscles at the lateral aspect of the ankle 6090 ms the failure supination or inversion torque is about 4145 nm to cause ligamentous rupture in simulated spraining tests on cadaver a previous case report revealed that the ankle joint reached 48 degrees inversion and 10 degrees internal rotation during an accidental grade i ankle ligamentous sprain injury during a dynamic cutting trial in laboratory diagnosis techniques and grading systems vary but the management of ankle ligamentous sprain injury is mainly conservative immobilization should not be used as it results in joint stiffness muscle atrophy and loss of proprioception traditional chinese medicine such as herbs massage and acupuncture were well applied in china in managing sports injuries and was reported to be effective in relieving pain reducing swelling and edema and restoring normal ankle function finally the best practice of sports medicine would be to prevent the injury different previous approaches including designing prophylactice devices introducing functional interventions as well as change of games rules were highlighted this paper allows the readers to catch up with the previous researches on ankle sprain injury and facilitate the future research idea on sport related ankle sprain injury author,Medicine
the purposes of this review are to identify the factors that contribute to the transference of strength and power training to sports performance and to provide resistance training guidelines using sprinting performance as an example exercises involving bilateral contractions of the leg muscles resulting in vertical movement such as squats and jump squats have minimal transfer to performance however plyometric training including unilateral exercises and horizontal movement of the whole body elicits significant increases in sprint acceleration performance thus highlighting the importance of movement pattern and contraction velocity specificity relatively large gains in power output in nonspecific movements intramuscular coordination can be accompanied by small changes in sprint performance research on neural adaptations to resistance training indicates that intermuscular coordination is an important component in achieving transfer to sports skills although the specificity of resistance training is important general strength training is potentially useful for the purposes of increasing body mass decreasing the risk of soft tissue injuries and developing core stability hypertrophy and general power exercises can enhance sports performance but optimal transfer from training also requires a specific exercise program author,Medicine

there is increasing interest in the potential neuropsychological impact of sports related concussion a meta analysis of the relevant literature was conducted to determine the impact of sports related concussion across six cognitive domains the analysis was based on 21 studies involving 790 cases of concussion and 2014 control cases the overall effect of concussion d 0 49 was comparable to the effect found in the non sports related mild traumatic brain injury population d 0 54 belanger et al 2005 using sports concussed participants with a history of prior head injury appears to inflate the effect sizes associated with the current sports related concussion acute effects within 24 hr of injury of concussion were greatest for delayed memory memory acquisition and global cognitive functioning d 1 00 1 03 and 1 42 respectively however no residual neuropsychological impairments were found when testing was completed beyond 7 days postinjury these findings were moderated by cognitive domain and comparison group control group versus preconcussion self control specifically delayed memory in studies utilizing a control group remained problematic at 7 days the implications and limitations of these findings are discussed author,Medicine
position statement the position of the society regarding caffeine supplementation and sport performance is summarized by the following seven points 1 caffeine is effective for enhancing sport performance in trained athletes when consumed in low to moderate dosages 3 6 mg kg and overall does not result in further enhancement in performance when consumed in higher dosages 9 mg kg 2 caffeine exerts a greater ergogenic effect when consumed in an anhydrous state as compared to coffee 3 it has been shown that caffeine can enhance vigilance during bouts of extended exhaustive exercise as well as periods of sustained sleep deprivation 4 caffeine is ergogenic for sustained maximal endurance exercise and has been shown to be highly effective for time trial performance 5 caffeine supplementation is beneficial for high intensity exercise including team sports such as soccer and rugby both of which are categorized by intermittent activity within a period of prolonged duration 6 the literature is equivocal when considering the effects of caffeine supplementation on strength power performance and additional research in this area is warranted 7 the scientific literature does not support caffeine induced diuresis during exercise or any harmful change in fluid balance that would negatively affect performance author,Medicine
the handicap principle is a simple but powerful metaphor that has had a major impact on how biologists study and understand sexual selection here i show that its application to signalling in sexual selection is not a valid generalization from its roots in economics although some signalling systems with additive costs and benefits have solutions that resemble sports handicaps the signalling in sexual selection has multiplicative costs and benefits and solutions that do not resemble sports handicaps the sports analogy is technically incorrect metaphorically misleading and a poor guide for empirical research on the signalling in sexual selection the evolution of sexually selected signals is not a missing piece of darwin s puzzle it is an integral piece of the process of evolution by natural selection and it should be approached with the same tools that we bring to bear on the evolution of other correlated traits involved in social interactions author,Medicine
many athletes especially female athletes and participants in endurance and aesthetic sports and sports with weight classes are chronically energy deficient this energy deficiency impairs performance growth and health reproductive disorders in female athletes are caused by low energy availability defined as dietary energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure perhaps specifically by low carbohydrate availability and not by the stress of exercise these reproductive disorders can be prevented or reversed by dietary supplementation in compensation for exercise energy expenditure without any moderation of the exercise regimen energy balance is not the objective of athletic training to maximize performance athletes strive to achieve an optimum sport specific body size body composition and mix of energy stores to pursue these objectives athletes need to manage fat protein and carbohydrate balances separately but it is impractical for athletes to monitor these balances directly and appetite is not a reliable indicator of their energy and macronutrient needs to guide their progress athletes need to eat by discipline and to monitor specific reliable and practical biomarkers of their objectives skinfolds and urinary ketones may be the best biomarkers of fat stores and carbohydrate deficiency respectively research is needed to identify and validate these and other markers author,Medicine

the ergogenic effects of caffeine on athletic performance have been shown in many studies and its broad range of metabolic hormonal and physiologic effects has been recorded as this review of the literature shows however few caffeine studies have been published to include cognitive and physiologic considerations for the athlete the following practical recommendations consider the global effects of caffeine on the body lower doses can be as effective as higher doses during exercise performance without any negative coincidence after a period of cessation restarting caffeine intake at a low amount before performance can provide the same ergogenic effects as acute intake caffeine can be taken gradually at low doses to avoid tolerance during the course of 3 or 4 days just before intense training to sustain exercise intensity and caffeine can improve cognitive aspects of performance such as concentration when an athlete has not slept well athletes and coaches also must consider how a person s body size age gender previous use level of tolerance and the dose itself all influence the ergogenic effects of caffeine on sports performance author,Medicine
injury classification systems are generally used in sports medicine 1 to accurately classify diagnoses for summary studies permitting easy grouping into parent categories for tabulation and 2 to create a database from which cases can be extracted for research on specific injuries clarity is most important for the first purpose whereas diagnostic detail is particularly important for the second an ideal classification system is versatile and appropriate for all sports and all data collection scenarios the orchard sports injury classification system osics was developed in 1992 primarily for the first purpose a specific study examining the incidence of injury at the elite level of football in australia as usage of the osics expanded into different sports limitations were noted and therefore many revisions have been made a recent study found the osics 8 whilst superior to the international classification of diseases australian modification icd 10 am in both speed of use and 3 coder agreement still achieved a lower level of agreement than expected the study also revealed weaknesses in the osics 8 that needed to be addressed a recent major revision resulted in the development of the new 4 character osics 10 this revision attempts to improve interuser agreement partly by including more diagnoses encountered in a sports medicine setting the osics 10 should provide far greater depth in classifications for the benefit of those looking to maintain diagnostic information it is also structured to easily collapse down into parent classifications for those wanting to preserve basic information only for those researchers wanting information collected under broader injury headings particularly those not using fully computerized systems the simplicity of the osics 8 system may still suffice author,Medicine
object nfemales comprise an increasing percentage of the athlete population across all age groups and analysis of recent literature reveals that they sustain more concussions in collegiate sports results of human and animal studies indicate that females may have poorer outcomes after traumatic brain injury however no return to play guideline takes sex or other individual differences into account in the present study the authors evaluated the influence of patient sex on objective neurocognitive performance and subjective reporting of symptoms following sports related concussion n n nmethods naccording to preseason baseline neurocognitive computerized testing in 2340 male and female high school and collegiate athletes individuals who sustained sports related concussions 155 persons were reevaluated using an alternate form of the cognitive test sex differences in the magnitude of cognitive change from baseline levels and the subjective experience of symptoms were analyzed to account for the possible protective effects of helmets comparisons were performed among females males with helmets and males without helmets none of the female athletes wore helmets female athletes had significantly greater declines in simple and complex reaction times relative to preseason baseline levels and they reported more postconcussion symptoms compared with males as a group females were cognitively impaired approximately 1 7 times more frequently than males following concussions furthermore females experienced more objective and subjective adverse effects from concussion even after adjusting for the use of helmets by some groups of male athletes for example in football n n nconclusions nreturn to play decisions and concussion management must be objective and made on an individual basis including consideration of factors such as patient sex rather than relying on a one size fits all guideline author,Medicine
in recent years fitness practitioners have increasingly recommended core stability exercises in sports conditioning programs greater core stability may benefit sports performance by providing a foundation for greater force production in the upper and lower extremities traditional resistance exercises have been modified to emphasize core stability such modifications have included performing exercises on unstable rather than stable surfaces performing exercises while standing rather than seated performing exercises with free weights rather than machines and performing exercises unilaterally rather than bilaterally despite the popularity of core stability training relatively little scientific research has been conducted to demonstrate the benefits for healthy athletes therefore the purpose of this review was to critically examine core stability training and other issues related to this topic to determine useful applications for sports conditioning programs based on the current literature prescription of core stability exercises should vary based on the phase of training and the health status of the athlete during preseason and in season mesocycles free weight exercises performed while standing on a stable surface are recommended for increases in core strength and power free weight exercises performed in this manner are specific to the core stability requirements of sports related skills due to moderate levels of instability and high levels of force production conversely during postseason and off season mesocycles swiss ball exercises involving isometric muscle actions small loads and long tension times are recommended for increases in core endurance furthermore balance board and stability disc exercises performed in conjunction with plyometric exercises are recommended to improve proprioceptive and reactive capabilities which may reduce the likelihood of lower extremity injuries author,Medicine

background nneurocognitive testing has been endorsed as a cornerstone of concussion management by recent vienna and prague meetings of the concussion in sport group neurocognitive testing is important given the potential unreliability of athlete self report after injury relying only on athletes reports of symptoms may result in premature return of athletes to contact sport potentially exposing them to additional injury n n nhypothesis nuse of computer based neurocognitive testing results in an increased capacity to detect postconcussive abnormalities after injury n n nstudy design ncase control study level of evidence 3 n n nmethods nhigh school and college athletes with a diagnosed concussion were tested 2 days after injury postinjury neurocognitive performance immediate postconcussion assessment and cognitive testing and symptom postconcussion symptom scores were compared with preinjury baseline scores and with those of an age and education matched noninjured athlete control group abnormal test performance was determined statistically with reliable change index scores n n nresults nsixty four percent of concussed athletes reported a significant increase in symptoms as judged by postconcussion symptom scores compared with preinjury baseline at 2 days after injury eighty three percent of the concussed sample demonstrated significantly poorer neurocognitive test results relative to their own baseline performance the addition of neurocognitive testing resulted in a net increase in sensitivity of 19 ninety three percent of the sample had either abnormal neurocognitive test results or a significant increase in symptoms relative to their own baseline 30 of a control group demonstrated either abnormalities in neurocognitive testing or elevated symptoms as judged by postconcussion symptom scores for the concussed group use of symptom and neurocognitive test results resulted in an increased yield of 29 overreliance on symptoms alone in contrast 0 of the control group had both symptoms and abnormal neurocognitive testing n n nconclusion nreliance on patients self reported symptoms after concussion is likely to result in underdiagnosis of concussion and may result in premature return to play neurocognitive testing increases diagnostic accuracy when used in conjunction with self reported symptoms author,Medicine
traditionally balance training has been used as part of the rehabilitation programme for ankle injuries more recently balance training has been adopted to try and prevent injuries to the ankle and knee joints during sport the purpose of this review is to synthesise current knowledge in the area of balance ability training and injury risk highlight the findings and identify any future research needs a number of studies have found that poor balance ability is significantly related to an increased risk of ankle injuries in different activities this relationship appears to be more common in males than females multifaceted intervention studies that have included balance training along with jumping landing and agility exercises have resulted in a significant decrease in ankle or knee injuries in team handball volleyball and recreational athletes it is unknown which component of the multifaceted intervention was most effective and whether the effects are additive as a single intervention balance training has been shown to significantly reduce the recurrence of ankle ligament injuries in soccer volleyball and recreational athletes however it has not been clearly shown to reduce ankle injuries in athletes without a prior ankle injury balance training on its own has also been shown to significantly reduce anterior cruciate ligament injuries in male soccer players surprisingly it was also found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of major knee injuries in female soccer players and overuse knee injuries in male and female volleyball players the studies with the contrasting findings differed in aspects of their balance training programmes it would appear that balance training as a single intervention is not as effective as when it is part of a multifaceted intervention research is required to determine the relative contribution of balance training to a multifaceted intervention so as to generate an effective and efficient preventative programme that can be adopted by athletes of most levels author,Medicine
in humans hormonal responses to winning losing and their relationships to mood and status change have mostly been examined in individual athletic competitions in this study the salivary testosterone t and cortisol c and mood responses to a real match between two professional basketball teams were investigated data about individuals contributions to outcome performance appraisal and attribution of outcome to internal external factors were also collected results did not show statistically significant different t and c responses depending on the outcome negative mood was significantly enhanced especially in the losers while winners showed a better appraisal of team performance and a more internal attribution t response did not show a significant relationship with mood changes but it correlated positively with the score time playing ratio an indicator of individual participation in the outcome furthermore t response correlated negatively with external attribution in winners and positively in losers these results indicate that in a real highly competitive situation t changes are not directly a response to the outcome but rather to the contribution the individual makes to it and to the causes he attributes author,Medicine
meniscal injuries produce disability in a large portion of the population and sports injuries are a common cause nicholas emphasized the importance of epidemiologic studies in an effort to better define the risk of various sports there are significant regional differences in sports related meniscal injuries depending upon the popularity of specific sports although publications in the european literature document some of these variations there is little epidemiologic documentation of the variation in specific areas of the united states meniscectomies performed in syracuse new york from 1973 to 1982 were reviewed sports related meniscal injuries were tabulated and compared against all other causes our results indicate that the incidence of meniscal injury resulting in meniscectomy is 61 per 100 000 population the sex ratio was three males to one female medial versus lateral meniscus injury was 81 versus 19 football had a 75 predominance of medial meniscectomy basketball 75 wrestling 55 skiing 78 and baseball 90 our data indicate that there are differences in the ratio of medial versus lateral meniscal disruption associated with specific sports activities medial meniscal injuries were nevertheless consistently more common in all of our categories except wrestling where the frequency of lateral meniscal tear is nearly equal to that of medial meniscal tear additionally the right knee is at a greater risk of meniscal injury in basketball than in other sports or the general population and female skiers are at equal or greater risk of meniscal injury compared to male skiers author,Medicine

neurocognitive status is often considered the domain of neurologic functioning most sensitive to change following concussion but the effects are often subtle and difficult to detect on routine clinical examination recent efforts have focused on the development of brief standardized methods of mental status assessment for use by sports medicine clinicians to quantify the acute neurocognitive effects of concussion and objectively track postinjury recovery research has demonstrated the reliability validity and sensitivity of these measures in detecting concussion in athletes and providing empirical data for consideration in the context of other examination findings neuropsychologic test data and neuroimaging results standardized measures of mental status and other postconcussive symptoms are valuable tools to assist clinicians in the assessment and management of concussion but should not be used as a replacement for medical evaluation or viewed as a stand alone means for determining readiness to return to competition after injury author,Medicine
summarythe training of competitive athletes can be assessed by retrospective questionnaires diaries physiological monitoring and direct observation of training behaviour questionnaires represent the most economical most comprehensive and least accurate method diaries are more valid but their drawbacks for long term quantitative studies are poor compliance and difficulties in processing the data they generate physiological monitoring of oxygen consumption heart rate or blood lactate concentration provides objective measures of training intensity and direct observation gives valid measures of most aspects of training however these methods are impractical for continuous long term use coaches and athletes quantify training for purposes of motivation systematisation of training and training prescription but there has been little study of the use of training quantification by these practitioners motivation and systematisation are probably achieved best with diaries direct observation appears to be the best method of ensuring compliance with a training prescription although heart rate monitoring is also a promising method for prescribing endurance training intensity sport scientists quantify training to study its effects on the performance and health status of competitive athletes most studies have been descriptive rather than experimental and unvalidated questionnaires have been the predominant method of assaying training the main areas of research include performance prediction and enhancement overtraining reproductive dysfunction injury illness and nutritional status training has substantial effects in all of these areas there is a need for more experimental studies that utilise validated measures of training to investigate how to reduce sports injuries and enhance competitive sports performance more attention could also be given to methodological issues of training quantification author,Medicine
summarythe use of cold therapy in acute sports injuries as well as in the rehabilitation of the injured athlete has become a generally accepted treatment method various cooling modalities are used to apply cold to the injured area e g ice packs ice towels ice massage frozen gel packs ethyl chloride and other vapocoolants chemical reaction devices and inflatable splints using refrigerant gas most clinical studies report that the use of cryotherapy has a positive effect on pain reduction and on the recovery of various injuries when the physiological processes produced by cryotherapy are examined in experimental situations some of these reactions differ from expectations skin subcutaneous intramuscular and joint temperature changes depend on application method initial temperature and application time intramuscular temperature continues to drop after the cooling modality has been removed results of various studies are consistent on the effects on neuromuscular and pain processes results of studies on cold and blood flow vary considerably however it appears that blood flow increases with superficial cold application and decreases when cold is applied to large skin surface areas motor performance is affected by temperature with a critical temperature being around 18c above and beneath which muscle performance decreases there is also a critical temperature for the application of cold with inflammation and oedema increasing at temperatures below 15c precautions should be taken because prolonged application at very low temperatures could have deleterious effects author,Medicine
any sport has an inherent risk of injury a balance must be reached between maintaining a competitive edge in a sport and ensuring participant safety frequently the loss of objectivity on the part of the athlete coaches sports media and spectators is an unfortunate and potentially harmful bias in that setting the health professional s role is to provide objective assessment of the injured athlete and guidance about the advisability of safe return to competition n nthere are three main issues that should be addressed by any guideline for the management of concussion the health outcomes that need to be addressed at the time of the injury and during the follow up period include 1 the appropriate management of the injured athlete at the time of injury to identify potential neurosurgical emergencies epidural subdural and intracerebral hemorrhages 2 the prevention of catastrophic outcome related to acute brain swelling and 3 the avoidance of cumulative brain injury related to repeated concussions n nmild traumatic brain injury typically does not require neurosurgical intervention and the treatment of postconcussion symptoms often falls to the neurologist 1 questions addressed during neurologic or neurosurgical consultation for sports related concussion call for advice to the patient that is guided by neuroscience and the consensus of experts rather than local lore and individual opinion most importantly consultation regarding the prevention of catastrophic outcome and cumulative neurobehavioral deficits from repeated concussions can best be provided by the well informed physician this report based on a project already completed by the colorado medical society 2 was written to provide background information for a practice parameter of the american academy of neurology aan 3 n ndisagreement about the terminology of mild traumatic brain injury and concerns about the proper management of sports related concussion led to the development of this document several articles and textbook chapters have appeared author,Medicine

context nmany coaches parents and children believe that the best way to develop elite athletes is for them to participate in only 1 sport from an early age and to play it year round however emerging evidence to the contrary indicates that efforts to specialize in 1 sport may reduce opportunities for all children to participate in a diverse year round sports season and can lead to lost development of lifetime sports skills early sports specialization may also reduce motor skill development and ongoing participation in games and sports as a lifestyle choice the purpose of this review is to employ the current literature to provide evidence based alternative strategies that may help to optimize opportunities for all aspiring young athletes to maximize their health fitness and sports performance n n nevidence acquisition nnonsystematic review with critical appraisal of existing literature n n nstudy design nclinical review n n nlevel of evidence nlevel 4 n n nconclusion nbased on the current evidence parents and educators should help provide opportunities for free unstructured play to improve motor skill development and youth should be encouraged to participate in a variety of sports during their growing years to influence the development of diverse motor skills for those children who do choose to specialize in a single sport periods of intense training and specialized sport activities should be closely monitored for indicators of burnout overuse injury or potential decrements in performance due to overtraining last the evidence indicates that all youth should be involved in periodized strength and conditioning eg integrative neuromuscular training to help them prepare for the demands of competitive sport participation and youth who specialize in a single sport should plan periods of isolated and focused integrative neuromuscular training to enhance diverse motor skill development and reduce injury risk factors n n nstrength of recommendation taxonomy sort nb author,Medicine
context nsports specialization is intense training in 1 sport while excluding others sports specialization in early to middle childhood has become increasingly common while most experts agree that some degree of sports specialization is necessary to achieve elite levels there is some debate as to whether such intense practice time must begin during early childhood and to the exclusion of other sports to maximize potential for success there is a concern that sports specialization before adolescence may be deleterious to a young athlete n n nevidence acquisition npubmed and ovid were searched for english language articles from 1990 to 2011 discussing sports specialization expert athletes or elite versus novice athletes including original research articles consensus opinions and position statements n n nresults nfor most sports there is no evidence that intense training and specialization before puberty are necessary to achieve elite status risks of early sports specialization include higher rates of injury increased psychological stress and quitting sports at a young age sports specialization occurs along a continuum survey tools are being developed to identify where athletes fall along the spectrum of specialization n n nconclusion nsome degree of sports specialization is necessary to develop elite level skill development however for most sports such intense training in a single sport to the exclusion of others should be delayed until late adolescence to optimize success while minimizing injury psychological stress and burnout author,Medicine
it is the position of sports dietitians australia sda that adolescent athletes have unique nutritional requirements as a consequence of undertaking daily training and competition in addition to the demands of growth and development as such sda established an expert multidisciplinary panel to undertake an independent review of the relevant scientific evidence and consulted with its professional members to develop sports nutrition recommendations for active and competitive adolescent athletes the position of sda is that dietary education and recommendations for these adolescent athletes should reinforce eating for long term health more specifically the adolescent athlete should be encouraged to moderate eating patterns to reflect daily exercise demands and provide a regular spread of high quality carbohydrate and protein sources over the day especially in the period immediately after training sda recommends that consideration also be given to the dietary calcium vitamin d and iron intake of adolescent athletes due to the elevated risk of deficiency of these nutrients to maintain optimal hydration adolescent athletes should have access to fluids that are clean cool and supplied in sufficient quantities before during and after participation in sport finally it is the position of sda that nutrient needs should be met by core foods rather than supplements as the recommendation of dietary supplements to developing athletes over emphasizes their ability to manipulate performance in comparison with other training and dietary strategies author,Medicine
backgroundthe epidemiology of sports related concussion is not well described in the literature this paper presents a descriptive epidemiology of concussion in seven high school and collegiate sports methodswe used the data from concussion prevention initiative cpi which enrolled 8905 athletes at 210 high schools and 26 colleges in a prospective cohort study of 7 sports football mens and womens soccer mens and womens lacrosse and mens and womens ice hockey between 1999 and 2001 injury risks and injury rates were used to characterize the incidence of concussion and changes in symptoms over time were described resultsa total of 375 concussions were observed the incidence of concussion was highest in football followed by womens lacrosse mens lacrosse mens soccer and womens soccer only 10 ice hockey teams were included too few to quantify incidence the rate of incident concussion was strongly associated with history of concussion in the previous 24months rate ratio 5 5 95 ci 3 9 7 8 for 2 or more concussions relative to no previous concussion the most common symptoms at time of injury were headache 87 balance problems dizziness 77 and feeling in a fog 62 loss of consciousness and amnesia were present in relatively few cases 9 and 30 the most common mechanism of injury was collision with another player conclusionssports related concussions present with a diverse range of symptoms and are associated with previous concussion history author,Medicine
global positioning system gps technology was made possible after the invention of the atomic clock the first suggestion that gps could be used to assess the physical activity of humans followed some 40 y later there was a rapid uptake of gps technology with the literature concentrating on validation studies and the measurement of steady state movement the first attempts were made to validate gps for field sport applications in 2006 while gps has been validated for applications for team sports some doubts continue to exist on the appropriateness of gps for measuring short high velocity movements thus gps has been applied extensively in australian football cricket hockey rugby union and league and soccer there is extensive information on the activity profile of athletes from field sports in the literature stemming from gps and this includes total distance covered by players and distance in velocity bands global positioning systems have also been applied to detect fatigue in matches identify periods of most intense play different activity profiles by position competition level and sport more recent research has integrated gps data with the physical capacity or fitness test score of athletes game specific tasks or tactical or strategic information the future of gps analysis will involve further miniaturization of devices longer battery life and integration of other inertial sensor data to more effectively quantify the effort of athletes author,Medicine

bone mass can be viewed as the net product of two counteracting metabolic processes bone formation and bone resorption which allow the skeleton to carry out its principal functions mechanical support of the body calcium dynamic deposition and haemopoiesis besides radiological methods several blood and urinary molecules have been identified as markers of bone metabolic activity for estimating the rates and direction of the biological activities governing bone turnover the advantages for the use of bone metabolism markers are that they are potentially less dangerous than radiological determinations are more sensitive to changes in bone metabolism than radiological methods and are easily collected and analysed the disadvantages are that they have high biological variability physical exercise is a known source of bone turnover and is recommended for preventing osteoporosis and bone metabolism problems there are numerous experiments on bone metabolism markers after acute exercise but not after long term training and during or after a whole competition season moreover few studies on bone metabolism markers have evaluated their performance in elite and top level athletes who have a higher bone turnover than sedentary individuals despite discrepant results among studies most have shown that short exercise is insufficient for modifying serum concentrations of bone metabolism markers marker variations are more evident after several hours or days after exercise bone formation markers are more sensitive than bone resorption markers and stimulation of osteoblast and or osteoclast functions is exercise dependent but the response is not immediate the response depends on the type of exercise the markers seem to be less sensitive to resistance exercise and the intensity of exercise is not discriminate comparisons between trained subjects and untrained controls have demonstrated the influence of exercise on bone turnover during training carboxy terminal collagen cross links ctx a bone resorption marker was shown to be less sensitive than amino terminal cross linking telopeptide of type i collagen ntx and urinary pyridinolines which were sensitive to anaerobic exercise whereas the bone formation markers bone alkaline phosphatase bap and osteocalcin oc changed after 1 month and 2 months of an exercise programme respectively after 2 months while bap normalized it was found to be sensitive to aerobic exercise and oc was found to be sensitive to anaerobic exercise after prolonged training and competition bone formation markers are found to change in sedentary subjects enrolled in a physical activity programme professional athletes show changes in bone formation markers depending on programme intensity whereas bone resorption appears to stabilize crucial for long term training are the characteristics of exercise e g weight bearing impact author,Medicine
total creatin kinase ck and lactate dehydrogenase ldh serum levels depend on age gender race muscle mass physical activity and climatic conditions high ck serum levels in athletes following rest and without any further predisposing factors should prompt a full diagnostic workup with special regards to signs of muscle weakness or other signs not always evident in subjects who have silent myopathy repeated intense prolonged exercise may produce negative effects because given the continuous loss of muscle proteins it does not induce the physiological muscle adaptations to physical training serum total ldh and specific isozyme activities change with the training status of the athlete variation in ldh isozymes profile might have a role in studying muscle response to training author,Medicine
endurance sports are increasing in popularity and athletes at all levels are looking for ways to optimize their performance by training and nutrition for endurance exercise lasting 30 min or more the most likely contributors to fatigue are dehydration and carbohydrate depletion whereas gastrointestinal problems hyperthermia and hyponatraemia can reduce endurance exercise performance and are potentially health threatening especially in longer events gt 4 h although high muscle glycogen concentrations at the start may be beneficial for endurance exercise this does not necessarily have to be achieved by the traditional supercompensation protocol an individualized nutritional strategy can be developed that aims to deliver carbohydrate to the working muscle at a rate that is dependent on the absolute exercise intensity as well as the duration of the event endurance athletes should attempt to minimize dehydration and limit body mass losses through sweating to 2 3 of body mass gastrointestinal problems occur frequently especially in long distance races problems seem to be highly individual and perhaps genetically determined but may also be related to the intake of highly concentrated carbohydrate solutions hyperosmotic drinks as well as the intake of fibre fat and protein hyponatraemia has occasionally been reported especially among slower competitors with very high intakes of water or other low sodium drinks here i provide a comprehensive overview of recent research findings and suggest several new guidelines for the endurance athlete on the basis of this these guidelines are more detailed and allow a more individualized approach author,Medicine
despite negative neuroimaging findings in concussed athletes studies indicate that the acceleration and deceleration of the brain after concussive impacts result in metabolic and electrophysiological alterations that may be attributable to changes in white matter resulting from biomechanical strain in the present study we investigated the effects of sports concussion on white matter using three different diffusion tensor imaging dti measures fractional anisotropy fa mean diffusivity md and axial diffusivity ad we compared a group of 10 non concussed athletes with a group of 18 concussed athletes of the same age mean age 22 5 years and education mean 16 years using a voxel based approach vba in both the acute and chronic post injury phases all concussed athletes were scanned 1 6 days post concussion and again 6 months later in a 3t siemens trio mri three 22 repeated measures analyses of variance anovas were conducted one for each measure of dti used in the current study there was a main group effect of fa which was increased in dorsal regions of both corticospinal tracts cst and in the corpus callosum in concussed athletes at both time points there was a main group effect of ad in the right cst where concussed athletes showed elevated values relative to controls at both time points md values were decreased in concussed athletes in whom analyses revealed significant group differences in the cst and corpus callosum at both time points although the use of vba does limit the analyses to large tracts and it has clinical limitations with regard to individual analyses our results nevertheless indicate that sports concussions do result in changes in diffusivity in the corpus callosum and cst that are not detected using conventional neuroimaging techniques author,Medicine
implementation of a nutrition programme for team sports involves application of scientific research together with the social skills necessary to work with a sports medicine and coaching staff both field and court team sports are characterized by intermittent activity requiring a heavy reliance on dietary carbohydrate sources to maintain and replenish glycogen energy and substrate demands are high during pre season training and matches and moderate during training in the competitive season dietary planning must include enough carbohydrate on a moderate energy budget while also meeting protein needs strength and power team sports require muscle building programmes that must be accompanied by adequate nutrition and simple anthropometric measurements can help the nutrition practitioner monitor and assess body composition periodically use of a body mass scale and a urine specific gravity refractometer can help identify athletes prone to dehydration sports beverages and caffeine are the most common supplements while opinion on the practical effectiveness of creatine is divided late maturing adolescent athletes become concerned about gaining size and muscle and assessment of maturity status can be carried out with anthropometric procedures an overriding consideration is that an individual approach is needed to meet each athlete s nutritional needs author,Medicine

summaryflexibility measures can be static end of rom range of motion dynamic passive stiffness compliance or dynamic active muscle contracted stiffness compliance dynamic measures of flexibility are less dependent on patient discomfort and are more objective acute and chronic changes in flexibility are likely to occur with stretching exercises but it is difficult to distinguish between changes in stretch tolerance as opposed to changes in muscle stiffness how flexibility is measured impacts these findings there is no scientifically based prescription for flexibility training and no conclusive statements can be made about the relationship of flexibility to athletic injury the literature reports opposing findings from different samples frequently does not distinguish between strain sprain and overuse injury and rarely uses the proper denominator of exposure there is basic scientific evidence to suggest that active warm up may be protective against muscle strain injury but clinical research is equivocal on this point typically specific flexibility patterns are associated with specific sports and even positions within sports the relationship of flexibility to athletic performance is likely to be sport dependent decreased flexibility has been associated with increased in line running and walking economy increased stiffness may be associated with increased isometric and concentric force generation and muscle energy storage may be best manifested by closely matching muscle stiffness to the frequency of movement in stretch shorten type contractions author,Medicine
dieting is an important risk factor for disordered eating and eating disorders disordered eating occurs on a continuum from dieting and restrictive eating abnormal eating behavior and finally clinical eating disorders the prevalence of eating disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the cause of starting to diet is related to a perception of the paradigm of appearance in the specific sport b perceived performance improvements and c sociocultural pressures for thinness or an ideal body athletes most at risk for disordered eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin body size shape a high power to weight ratio and or sports utilizing weight categories such as in some high intensity sports in addition to dieting personality factors pressure to lose weight frequent weight cycling early start of sport specific training overtraining injuries and unfortunate coaching behavior are important risk factors to prevent disordered eating and eating disorders the athletes have to practice healthy eating and the medical staff of teams and parents must be able to recognize symptoms indicating risk for eating disorders coaches and leaders must accept that disordered eating can be a problem in the athletic community and that openness regarding this challenge is important author,Medicine

significant criticisms have emerged on the way that collective behaviours in team sports have been traditionally evaluated a major recommendation has been for future research and practice to focus on the interpersonal relationships developed between team players during performance most research has typically investigated team game performance in subunits attack or defence rather than considering the interactions of performers within the whole team in this paper we offer the view that team performance analysis could benefit from the adoption of biological models used to explain how repeated interactions between grouping individuals scale to emergent social collective behaviours we highlight the advantages of conceptualizing sports teams as functional integrated super organisms and discuss innovative measurement tools which might be used to capture the superorganismic properties of sports teams these tools are suitable for revealing the idiosyncratic collective behaviours underlying the cooperative and competitive tendencies of different sports teams particularly their coordination of labour and the most frequent channels of communication and patterns of interaction between team players the principles and tools presented here can serve as the basis for novel approaches and applications of performance analysis devoted to understanding sports teams as cohesive functioning high order organisms exhibiting their own peculiar behavioural patterns author,Medicine

position statementthe international society of sports nutrition issn provides an objective and critical review of the mechanisms and use of beta alanine supplementation based on the current available literature the conclusions of the issn are as follows 1 four weeks of beta alanine supplementation 46 g daily significantly augments muscle carnosine concentrations thereby acting as an intracellular ph buffer 2 beta alanine supplementation currently appears to be safe in healthy populations at recommended doses 3 the only reported side effect is paraesthesia tingling but studies indicate this can be attenuated by using divided lower doses 1 6 g or using a sustained release formula 4 daily supplementation with 4 to 6 g of beta alanine for at least 2 to 4 weeks has been shown to improve exercise performance with more pronounced effects in open end point tasks time trials lasting 1 to 4 min in duration 5 beta alanine attenuates neuromuscular fatigue particularly in older subjects and preliminary evidence indicates that beta alanine may improve tactical performance 6 combining beta alanine with other single or multi ingredient supplements may be advantageous when supplementation of beta alanine is high enough 46 g daily and long enough minimum 4weeks 7 more research is needed to determine the effects of beta alanine on strength endurance performance beyond 25min in duration and other health related benefits associated with carnosine author,Medicine
performance enhancing substances pess have unfortunately become ubiquitous in numerous sports often tarnishing the spirit of competition reported rates of pes use among athletes are variable and range from 5 to 31 more importantly some of these substances pose a serious threat to the health and well being of athletes common pess include anabolicandrogenic steroids human growth hormone creatine erythropoietin and blood doping amphetamines and stimulants and beta hydroxy beta methylbutyrate with recent advances in technology gene doping is also becoming more conceivable sports medicine physicians are often unfamiliar with these substances and thus do not routinely broach the topic of pess with their patients however to effect positive change in the sports community physicians must educate themselves about the physiology performance benefits adverse effects and testing methods in turn physicians can then educate athletes at all levels and prevent the use of potentially dangerous pess author,Medicine
background ncurrent methods for injury registration in sports injury epidemiology studies may substantially underestimate the true burden of overuse injuries due to a reliance on time loss injury definitions n n nobjective nto develop and validate a new method for the registration of overuse injuries in sports n n nmethods na new method including a new overuse injury questionnaire was developed and validated in a 13 week prospective study of injuries among 313 athletes from five different sports cross country skiing floorball handball road cycling and volleyball all athletes completed a questionnaire by email each week to register problems in the knee lower back and shoulder standard injury registration methods were also used to record all time loss injuries that occurred during the study period n n nresults nthe new method recorded 419 overuse problems in the knee lower back and shoulder during the 3 month study period of these 142 were classified as substantial overuse problems defined as those leading to moderate or severe reductions in sports performance or participation or time loss each week an average of 39 of athletes reported having overuse problems and 13 reported having substantial problems in contrast standard methods of injury registration registered only 40 overuse injuries located in the same anatomical areas the majority of which were of minimal or mild severity n n nconclusion nstandard injury surveillance methods only capture a small percentage of the overuse problems affecting the athletes largely because few problems led to time loss from training or competition the new method captured a more complete and nuanced picture of the burden of overuse injuries in this cohort author,Medicine

individual and unorganized sports with a health related focus such as recreational running have grown extensively in the last decade consistent with this development there has been an exponential increase in the availability and use of electronic monitoring devices such as smartphone applications apps and sports watches these electronic devices could provide support and monitoring for unorganized runners who have no access to professional trainers and coaches the purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the characteristics of event runners who use running related apps and sports watches this knowledge is useful from research design and marketing perspectives to adequately address unorganized runners needs and to support them in healthy and sustainable running through personalized technology data used in this study are drawn from the standardized online eindhoven running survey 2014 ers14 in total 2 172 participants in the half marathon eindhoven 2014 completed the questionnaire a response rate of 40 0 binary logistic regressions were used to analyze the impact of socio demographic variables running related variables and psychographic characteristics on the use of running related apps and sports watches next consumer profiles were identified the results indicate that the use of monitoring devices is affected by socio demographics as well as sports related and psychographic variables and this relationship depends on the type of monitoring device therefore distinctive consumer profiles have been developed to provide a tool for designers and manufacturers of electronic running related devices to better target unorganized runners needs through personalized and differentiated approaches apps are more likely to be used by younger less experienced and involved runners hence apps have the potential to target this group of novice less trained and unorganized runners in contrast sports watches are more likely to be used by a different group of runners older and more experienced runners with higher involvement although apps and sports watches may potentially promote and stimulate sports participation these electronic devices do require a more differentiated approach to target specific needs of runners considerable efforts in terms of personalization and tailoring have to be made to develop the full potential of these electronic devices as drivers for healthy and sustainable sports participation author,Medicine
the rating of perceived exertion rpe is a recognized marker of intensity and of homeostatic disturbance during exercise it is typically monitored during exercise tests to complement other measures of intensity the purpose of this commentary is to highlight the remarkable value of rpe as a psychophysiological integrator in adults it can be used in such diverse fashions as to predict exercise capacity assess changes in training status and explain changes in pace and pacing strategy in addition to using rpe to self regulate exercise a novel application of the intensity rpe relationship is to clamp rpe at various levels to produce self paced bouts of exercise which can be used to assess maximal functional capacity research also shows that the rate of increase in rpe during self paced competitive events of varying distance or constant load tasks where the participant exercises until volitional exhaustion is proportional to the duration that remains these findings suggest that the brain regulates rpe and performance in an anticipatory manner based on awareness of metabolic reserves at the start of an event and certainty of the anticipated end point changes in pace may be explained by a continuous internal negotiation of momentary rpe compared with a preplanned ideal rate of rpe progression template which takes into account the portion of distance covered and the anticipated end point these observations have led to the development of new techniques to analyze the complex relationship of rpe and pacing the use of techniques to assess frontal cortex activity will lead to further advances in understanding author,Medicine

early detection and improved treatments for cancer have resulted in roughly 12 million survivors alive in the united states today this growing population faces unique challenges from their disease and treatments including risk for recurrent cancer other chronic diseases and persistent adverse effects on physical functioning and quality of life historically clinicians advised cancer patients to rest and to avoid activity however emerging research on exercise has challenged this recommendation to this end a roundtable was convened by american college of sports medicine to distill the literature on the safety and efficacy of exercise training during and after adjuvant cancer therapy and to provide guidelines the roundtable concluded that exercise training is safe during and after cancer treatments and results in improvements in physical functioning quality of life and cancer related fatigue in several cancer survivor groups implications for disease outcomes and survival are still unknown nevertheless the benefits to physical functioning and quality of life are sufficient for the recommendation that cancer survivors follow the 2008 physical activity guidelines for americans with specific exercise programming adaptations based on disease and treatment related adverse effects the advice to avoid inactivity even in cancer patients with existing disease or undergoing difficult treatments is likely helpful author,Medicine
unlabelled npurpose of the statement to provide an evidence based best practises summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion to establish the level of evidence knowledge gaps and areas requiring additional research n n nimportance of an amssm statement n sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return to play rtp decisions the care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion competence should be determined by training and experience not dictated by specialty while this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion n n ndefinition n concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury mtbi which is generally self limited and at the less severe end of the brain injury spectrum n n npathophysiology n animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction n n nincidence n it is estimated that as many as 3 8 million concussions occur in the usa per year during competitive sports and recreational activities however as many as 50 of the concussions may go unreported concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in football hockey rugby soccer and basketball risk factors for sport related concussion a history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another concussion a greater number severity and duration of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery in sports with similar playing rules the reported incidence of concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes certain sports positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk of concussion youth athletes may have a more prolonged recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury preinjury mood disorders learning disorders attention deficit disorders add adhd and migraine headaches complicate diagnosis and management of a concussion n n ndiagnosis of concussion n concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and evaluation of concussion graded symptom checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the evaluation of concussion although limited validation of these assessment tools is available n n nsideline evaluation and management n any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions recognition and initial assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist cognitive evaluation including orientation past and immediate memory new learning and concentration balance tests and further neurological physical examination while standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for examination the sensitivity specificity validity and reliability of these tests among different age groups cultural groups and settings is largely undefined their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test is also largely unknown balance disturbance is a specific indicator of a concussion but not very sensitive balance testing on the sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of differences in shoe cleat type or surface use of ankle tape or braces or the presence of other lower extremity injury imaging is reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected there is no same day rtp for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status n n nneuropsychological testing n neuropsychological np tests are an objective measure of brain behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle cognitive impairment than clinical exam most concussions can be managed appropriately without the use of np testing computerised neuropsychological cnp testing should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test limitations including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index baseline variability and false positive and false negative rates paper and pencil np tests can be more comprehensive test different domains and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment of concussion np testing should be used only as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation the ideal timing frequency and type of np testing have not been determined in some cases properly administered and interpreted np testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions it is unknown if use of np testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent recurrent concussion catastrophic injury or long term complications comprehensive np evaluation is helpful in the post concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses n n nreturn to class n students will require cognitive rest and may require academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests while recovering from a concussion n n nreturn to play n concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise a rtp progression involves a gradual step wise increase in physical demands sports specific activities and the risk for contact if symptoms occur with activity the progression should be halted and restarted at the preceding symptom free step rtp after concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions short term risks of premature rtp the primary concern with early rtp is decreased reaction time leading to an increased risk of a repeat concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms long term effects there is an increasing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent concussions contribute to long term neurological sequelae some studies have suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction large scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define risk factors and causation of any long term neurological impairment n n ndisqualification from sport n there are no evidence based guidelines for disqualifying retiring an athlete from a sport after a concussion each case should be carefully deliberated and an individualised approach to determining disqualification taken n n neducation n greater efforts are needed to educate involved parties including athletes parents coaches officials school administrators and healthcare providers to improve concussion recognition management and prevention physicians should be prepared to provide counselling regarding potential long term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions n n nprevention n primary prevention of some injuries may be possible with modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play helmets both hard football lacrosse and hockey and soft soccer rugby are best suited to prevent impact injuries fracture bleeding laceration etc but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of concussions there is no current evidence that mouth guards can reduce the severity of or prevent concussions secondary prevention may be possible by appropriate rtp management n n nlegislation n legislative efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and non scholastic sports organisations regarding concussion safety and management n n nfuture directions n additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools delineate the role of np testing and improve identification of those at risk of prolonged post concussive symptoms or other long term complications evolving technologies for the diagnosis of concussion such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological markers may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports

the purpose of this position stand is to provide an overview of issues critical to understanding the importance of exercise and physical activity in older adult populations the position stand is divided into three sections section 1 briefly reviews the structural and functional changes that characterize normal human aging section 2 considers the extent to which exercise and physical activity can influence the aging process and section 3 summarizes the benefits of both long term exercise and physical activity and shorter duration exercise programs on health and functional capacity although no amount of physical activity can stop the biological aging process there is evidence that regular exercise can minimize the physiological effects of an otherwise sedentary lifestyle and increase active life expectancy by limiting the development and progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions there is also emerging evidence for significant psychological and cognitive benefits accruing from regular exercise participation by older adults ideally exercise prescription for older adults should include aerobic exercise muscle strengthening exercises and flexibility exercises the evidence reviewed in this position stand is generally consistent with prior american college of sports medicine statements on the types and amounts of physical activity recommended for older adults as well as the recently published 2008 physical activity guidelines for americans all older adults should engage in regular physical activity and avoid an inactive lifestyle author,Medicine
summary nin 1995 the american college of sports medicine and the centers for disease control and prevention published national guidelines on physical activity and public health the committee on exercise and cardiac rehabilitation of the american heart association endorsed and supported these recommendations the purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists including physicians epidemiologists exercise scientists and public health specialists this panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic epidemiologic and clinical scientific data including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995 issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim and communications issues key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed a draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts comments were integrated into the final recommendation n n nprimary recommendation nto promote and maintain health all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate intensity aerobic endurance physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week i a combinations of moderate and vigorous intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation iia b for example a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days moderate intensity aerobic activity which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate can be accumulated toward the 30 min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes i b vigorous intensity activity is exemplified by jogging and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate in addition every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week iia a because of the dose response relation between physical activity and health persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity i a author,Medicine
overweight and obesity affects more than 66 of the adult population and is associated with a variety of chronic diseases weight reduction reduces health risks associated with chronic diseases and is therefore encouraged by major health agencies guidelines of the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi encourage a 10 reduction in weight although considerable literature indicates reduction in health risk with 3 to 5 reduction in weight physical activity pa is recommended as a component of weight management for prevention of weight gain for weight loss and for prevention of weight regain after weight loss in 2001 the american college of sports medicine acsm published a position stand that recommended a minimum of 150 min wk 1 of moderate intensity pa for overweight and obese adults to improve health however 200 300 min wk 1 was recommended for long term weight loss more recent evidence has supported this recommendation and has indicated more pa may be necessary to prevent weight regain after weight loss to this end we have reexamined the evidence from 1999 to determine whether there is a level at which pa is effective for prevention of weight gain for weight loss and prevention of weight regain evidence supports moderate intensity pa between 150 and 250 min wk 1 to be effective to prevent weight gain moderate intensity pa between 150 and 250 min wk 1 will provide only modest weight loss greater amounts of pa gt 250 min wk 1 have been associated with clinically significant weight loss moderate intensity pa between 150 and 250 min wk 1 will improve weight loss in studies that use moderate diet restriction but not severe diet restriction cross sectional and prospective studies indicate that after weight loss weight maintenance is improved with pa gt 250 min wk 1 however no evidence from well designed randomized controlled trials exists to judge the effectiveness of pa for prevention of weight regain after weight loss resistance training does not enhance weight loss but may increase fat free mass and increase loss of fat mass and is associated with reductions in health risk existing evidence indicates that endurance pa or resistance training without weight loss improves health risk there is inadequate evidence to determine whether pa prevents or attenuates detrimental changes in chronic disease risk during weight gain author,Medicine
there is great interest in developing physiological based biomarkers such as diffusion tensor imaging to aid in the management of concussion which is currently entirely dependent on clinical judgment however the time course for recovery of white matter abnormalities following sports related concussion src is unknown we collected diffusion tensor imaging and behavioral data in forty concussed collegiate athletes on average 1 64 days t1 n 33 8 33 days t2 n 30 and 32 15 days post concussion t3 n 26 with healthy collegiate contact sport athletes ha serving as controls n 46 we hypothesized that fractional anisotropy fa would be increased acutely and partially recovered by one month post concussion mood symptoms were assessed using structured interviews fa differences were assessed using both traditional and subject specific analyses an exploratory analysis of tau plasma levels was conducted in a subset of participants results indicated that mood symptoms improved over time post concussion but remained elevated at t3 relative to ha across both group and subject specific analyses concussed athletes exhibited increased fa in several white matter tracts at each visit post concussion with no longitudinal evidence of recovery increased fa at t1 and t3 was significantly associated with an independent real world outcome measure for return to play finally we observed a nonsignificant trend for reduced tau in plasma of concussed athletes at t1 relative to ha with tau significantly increasing by t2 these results suggest white matter abnormalities following src may persist beyond one month and have potential as an objective biomarker for concussion outcome hum brain mapp 37 833 845 2016 2015 wiley periodicals inc author,Medicine
small sided games ssgs incorporating skills sport specific movements at intensities sufficient to promote aerobic adaptations are being increasingly implemented in professional team sport environments small sided games are often employed by coaches based on the premise that the greatest training benefits occur when training simulates the specific movement patterns and physiological demands of the sport at present there is relatively little information regarding how ssg can best be used to improve physical capacities and technical and tactical skills in team sports it is possible that with some modifications e g number of players pitch size coach encouragement and wrestling such games may be physiologically beneficial for athletes with relatively high initial aerobic fitness levels for instance it has been shown that 3 a side soccer ssg resulted in higher intensity i e greater overall distance less jogging and walking higher heart rate and more tackling dribbling goal attempts and passes than 5 a side ssg likewise when player numbers were kept constant a larger playing area increased the intensity of the ssg with a smaller playing area having the opposite effect it has also been demonstrated that energy expenditure was similar between badminton and volleyball courts but lower than that obtained in a basketball court moreover it has been demonstrated in rugby that wrestling can increase the physical demands of ssg consistent coach encouragement can also increase training intensity although most rule changes have trivial or no effect on exercise intensity further research is required to examine the optimal periodization strategies of ssg training for the long term development of physiological capacity technical skill and tactical proficiency while also minimizing the associated risk of injuries author,Medicine
studies suggest that a lack of standardized knowledge may lead to underreporting and undertreatment of sports related concussion however there has been little work done to establish how this knowledge may affect athletes behaviors toward reporting their concussions and removing themselves from play we conducted an anonymous online survey to assess athletes knowledge of signs and symptoms of concussion and also sought to estimate the potential frequency of underreporting in a collegiate athlete cohort among 262 athletes who responded to the survey 43 of those with a history of concussion reported that they had knowingly hidden symptoms of a concussion to stay in a game and 22 of athletes overall indicated that they would be unlikely or very unlikely to report concussion symptoms to a coach or athletic trainer in the future these data suggest that there may be a substantial degree of underreporting of concussion among collegiate athletes despite most acknowledging that they have been formally educated about the risks of concussion author,Medicine
this position stand provides guidance on fluid replacement to sustain appropriate hydration of individuals performing physical activity the goal of prehydrating is to start the activity euhydrated and with normal plasma electrolyte levels prehydrating with beverages in addition to normal meals and fluid intake should be initiated when needed at least several hours before the activity to enable fluid absorption and allow urine output to return to normal levels the goal of drinking during exercise is to prevent excessive gt 2 body weight loss from water deficit dehydration and excessive changes in electrolyte balance to avert compromised performance because there is considerable variability in sweating rates and sweat electrolyte content between individuals customized fluid replacement programs are recommended individual sweat rates can be estimated by measuring body weight before and after exercise during exercise consuming beverages containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can provide benefits over water alone under certain circumstances after exercise the goal is to replace any fluid electrolyte deficit the speed with which rehydration is needed and the magnitude of fluid electrolyte deficits will determine if an aggressive replacement program is merited author,Medicine
physical activity has a positive impact on people s well being and it may also decrease the occurrence of chronic diseases activity recognition with wearable sensors can provide feedback to the user about his her lifestyle regarding physical activity and sports and thus promote a more active lifestyle so far activity recognition has mostly been studied in supervised laboratory settings the aim of this study was to examine how well the daily activities and sports performed by the subjects in unsupervised settings can be recognized compared to supervised settings the activities were recognized by using a hybrid classifier combining a tree structure containing a priori knowledge and artificial neural networks and also by using three reference classifiers activity data were collected for 68 h from 12 subjects out of which the activity was supervised for 21 h and unsupervised for 47 h activities were recognized based on signal features from 3 d accelerometers on hip and wrist and gps information the activities included lying down sitting and standing walking running cycling with an exercise bike rowing with a rowing machine playing football nordic walking and cycling with a regular bike the total accuracy of the activity recognition using both supervised and unsupervised data was 89 that was only 1 unit lower than the accuracy of activity recognition using only supervised data however the accuracy decreased by 17 unit when only supervised data were used for training and only unsupervised data for validation which emphasizes the need for out of laboratory data in the development of activity recognition systems the results support a vision of recognizing a wider spectrum and more complex activities in real life settings author,Medicine

phospholipids are essential components of all biological membranes phosphatidylcholine pc and phosphatidylserine ps are phosphatidyl phospholipids that are required for normal cellular structure and function the participation in physical activity often challenges a variety of physiological systems consequently the ability to maintain normal cellular function during activity can determine sporting performance the participation in prolonged intense exercise has been shown to reduce circulatory choline concentrations in some individuals as choline is a pre cursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine this finding has encouraged researchers to investigate the hypothesis that supplementation with pc or choline salts could enhance sporting performance although the available data that evaluates the effects of pc supplementation on performance are equivocal acute oral supplementation with pc 0 2 g pc per kg body mass has been demonstrated to improve performance in a variety of sporting activities where exercise has depleted circulatory choline concentrations short term oral supplementation with soy derived ps s ps has been reported to attenuate circulating cortisol concentrations improve perceived well being and reduce perceived muscle soreness after exercise more recently short term oral supplementation 750 mg per day of s ps for 10 days has been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity during high intensity cycling and tended to increase performance during intermittent running although more research is warranted to determine minimum dietary phospholipid requirements for optimal sporting performance these findings suggest that some participants might benefit from dietary interventions that increase the intakes of pc and ps author,Medicine
summaryin a 7 year review of 1 447 spine fractures 202 14 were due to sporting or recreational causes of which 84 42 were associated with paralysis this high incidence of catastrophic injury is second only to motor vehicle accidents snowmobiling 10 skiing 5 tobogganing 5 and ice hockey 3 accounted for approximately one quarter of these injuries snowmobile injuries rose steadily over this period and the main contributing factors were alcohol poor lighting young age and inappropriate terrain the skiing injuries occurred to novices and top class skiers alike with one third of those sustaining a fracture having associated paralysis in view of the terrain and the speeds involved this figure is unlikely to change an alarming trend was the subtle increase in cervical fractures due to ice hockey most of which were compression injuries with the neck in the neutral or slightly flexed position and secondary to a collision with the boards being decked from behind contributed to the impact the introduction of measures to reduce these injuries is mandatory since cervical fractures secondary to ice hockey were associated with permanent paralysis in 67 of the cases there are several points of initial management which require emphasis author,Medicine

while the crucial role of haemoglobin in aerobic exercise has been well accepted there is still a great deal of controversy about the optimal haematological parameters in the athletic population the initial part of this review will examine the question of anaemia in athletes the most common finding in athletes is a dilutional pseudoanaemia that is caused by a plasma volume expansion rather than an actual blood loss it is not a pathological state and normalizes with training cessation in 3 to 5 days this entity should be distinguished from conditions associated with lowered blood counts such as intravascular haemolysis or iron deficiency anaemia the evaluation of true anaemia states in the athlete must take into account not only blood losses secondary to exercise such as foot strike haemolysis or iron losses through sweat but non athletic causes as well depending on the age and sex of the athlete consideration must be given to evaluation of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary systems for blood loss finally a comprehensive nutritional history must be taken as athletes especially women are frequently not consuming adequate dietary iron the second section of the paper will deal with the very contentious issue of sickle cell trait while there have been studies demonstrating an increased risk of sudden death in people with sickle cell trait it is still quite rare and should not be used as a restriction to activity further studies have demonstrated that patients with sickle cell trait have an exercise capacity that is probably normal or near normal however in the cases of sudden death it has been secondary to rhabdomyolysis occurring among sickle cell trait athletes performing at intense exertion under hot conditions soon after arriving at altitude the recommendations are that athletes with sickle cell trait adhere to compliance with the general guidelines for fluid replacement and acclimatisation to hot conditions and altitude the final section of the paper examines the issue of haematological manipulation for the purposes of ergogenic improvement although experiments with blood doping revealed improvements in running time to exhaustion and maximal oxygen uptake the introduction of recombinant erythropoietin has rendered blood doping little more than a historical footnote however the improvements in performance are not without risk and the use of exogenous erythropoietin has the potential for increased viscosity of the blood and thrombosis with potentially fatal results until a definitive test is developed for detection of exogenous erythropoietin it will continue to be a part of elite athletics author,Medicine
abstractthere is no absolute protection against lightning because of its random and capricious nature however the risk of being struck by lightning can be substantially reduced there are general safety rules that apply to all athletic and recreational events the athlete should have a proactive plan that can be instituted when storms approach he she should go to a safe shelter before the storm arrives and stay there until the danger is gone because the location climate terrain and playing site vary with different sporting activities safety plans may have distinct elements for different recreational activities mountain climbers should know the weather patterns of their locale the highest frequency of lightning strikes in the rocky mountains occurs between 11am and 9pm during the months of april to september there is less chance of a hiker encountering lightning during the early morning hours many tourists are unaware of this pattern which may possibly explain the finding that most lightning victims are visitors from other states the bicyclist is as vulnerable as anyone in the open in the event of lightning he she should seek safe shelter and get off the bike rubber tires do not provide protection from lightning golfers continue to make the same mistakes year after year golfers should know to seek safe shelter clubhouse or closed metal vehicle before the storm arrives and not return prematurely to the golf course they should avoid isolated trees open fields unsafe sheds and metal poles they should separate from each other rather than gather together swimmers should get out of the pool and find a safe shelter safe areas do not include poolsides under awnings or under trees a nearby closed automobile may be the safest place until the danger is gone applying precautions when engaging in these sporting or recreational activities will help to minimise the risk of casualties or fatalities caused by lightning n author,Medicine

summaryviruses are ubiquitous and cause numerous infections in humans these may vary from asymptomatic infection to severe debilitating illness viruses enter the host cells to replicate using host synthetic mechanisms and thus are resistant to conventional antibiotics the human body responds to viral infection by synthesising specific antibody which can be used to aid diagnosis infectious mononucleosis glandular fever commonly affects the 15 to 30 years age group it may produce severe debility which may last a month or more coxsackie virus infection can produce symptoms of the common cold but may also invade heart muscle and produce myocarditis a potentially serious disease other viruses also produce a wide spectrum of disease recent evidence has shown that people undergoing severe mental or physical stress may have reduced immunity to viral infections there are risks associated with strenuous physical activity during the acute phase of viral infection and there are reports of sudden death and serious complications occurring in previously fit young adults who undertake vigorous exercise when in the acute phase of a viral illness abnormalities of skeletal muscle have been demonstrated in patients with viral infection and this may explain the loss of performance experienced by athletes after upper respiratory tract infection as a general rule for all but mild common colds it is advised that the athlete avoids hard training for the first month after infection author,Medicine
primary care physicians working with athletes need to ask about drug or supplement use a basic knowledge of ergogenic substances may help to establish rapport with athletes using these agents physicians should be aware that doses used by athletes are far in excess of the ones reported by the literature and that new substances are constantly being introduced it is hoped that increased awareness and knowledge of the more common ergogenic substances will lead to better education and health care for the athletic population author,Medicine
sickle cell trait sct can pose a grave risk for some athletes in the past decade in ncaa division i football no deaths have occurred from the play or practice of the game but 16 deaths have occurred from conditioning for the game and 10 63 of these deaths are tied to sct an excess of up to 21 fold research shows how and why during intense exercise bouts sickle cells can accumulate and logjam blood vessels causing explosive rhabdomyolysis that can kill sickling can begin in 2 to 5 min of all out exertion and can reach grave levels soon thereafter if the athlete struggles on or is urged on by coaches despite warning signs sickling collapse is an intensity syndrome that differs from other common causes of collapse tailored precautions can prevent sickling collapse and enable athletes with sct to thrive irrationally intense conditioning for a game puts the lives of healthy athletes with sct at risk author,Medicine

overall whitewater sports are relatively free of serious medical problems with submersion accidents trauma and overuse syndromes being the most commonly encountered afflictions various infectious diseases and environmental exposure problems may occur but serious illness or injury from such causes is infrequent nonetheless the growing popularity of whitewater sports along with increasing attempts by less experienced persons to navigate more difficult rivers underscores the need for physicians to be aware of the medical problems likely to be encountered in these activities so that they may appropriately counsel and prepare persons for these invigorating yet potentially dangerous pastimes author,Medicine
in rare cases the occupation be it at work or during professional and strenuous sports activities may give a clue to a patient s risk factors for dental erosion however no detrimental effects were described on a population level frequent contact to inorganic or organic acids at work could increase the occurrence and progression of erosion in some studies acid workers had significantly more teeth with erosive tooth wear than the controls clinical findings showed erosion mainly on upper anterior teeth and dentine hypersensitivity occupation groups at risk would mostly be found in the chemical industry but also others like wine tasters may have dental erosion a few case reports and studies have reported an association between sports activities and erosive tooth wear the cause could be direct acid exposure or strenuous exercise which may increase gastroesophageal reflux risk groups are swimmers exercising in water with low ph and athletes consuming frequently erosive sport drinks it has to be kept in mind that sports drinks and occupation can be for some patients a cofactor in the development or in the increase of dental erosion however it is unlikely that one or two isolated factors will be responsible for this multifactorial condition author,Medicine

strenuous exercise makes extraordinary demands the transition from rest to intensive physical activity can cause pathological changes in various organs particularly in the urinary tract hematuria microscopic or macroscopic is one of the abnormalities commonly found after sports activity this phenomenon can occur in noncontact sports such as rowing running and swimming as well as in contact sports boxing football and so forth the pathophysiology can be either traumatic or nontraumatic renal trauma and or bladder injury due to repeated impact of the posterior bladder wall against the bladder base can cause vascular lesions and consequently hematuria there are 2 mechanisms of nontraumatic injury 1 vasoconstriction of the splanchnic and renal vessels occurs during exercise in order that blood can be redistributed to the contracting skeletal muscles thus causing hypoxic damage to the nephron this results in increased glomerular permeability which would favor increased excretion of erythrocytes and protein into the urine 2 a relatively more marked constriction of the efferent glomerular arterioli results in an increased filtration pressure which favors increased excretion of protein and red blood cells into the urine it must be noted that sports hematuria differs from other conditions that may cause reddish discoloration of the urine due to physical exercise such as march hemoglobinuria and exercise myoglobinuria in the latter 2 abnormalities there is excretion of hemoglobin and myoglobin molecules in the urine and not whole blood or intact red blood cells sports hematuria usually has a benign self limited course however coexisting urinary tract pathological conditions should be excluded carefully author,Medicine

reticulocytes are the transitional cells from erythroblasts to mature erythrocytes reticulocytes are present in blood for a period of 14 days and can be recognized by staining with supravital dyes such as new methylene blue or fluorescent markers which couple residual nucleic acid molecules a hallmark of the immature forms of erythrocytes although reticulocytes could be counted through a microscope there is a standard of international committee for standardisation in haematology for manual counting this method is reported to be time consuming inaccurate and imprecise the integration of the reticulocyte count in automated haematology systems allowed the widespread use of these parameters although the lack of calibration material and different markers technologies and software used in automated systems could engender discrepancies among data obtained from different analytical systems the importance of reticulocytes in sports medicine derives from their sensitivity the highest among haematology parameters in identifying the bone marrow stimulation especially when recombinant human erythropoietin is fraudulently used automated systems are also able to supply information on volume density and the haemoglobin content of reticulocytes some of the related parameters are also used in algorithms for identifying abnormal stimulation of bone marrow as reticulocytes haematocrit the preanalytical variability of reticulocytes transportation storage biological variability should be taken into account in sports medicine also reticulocytes remain stable for almost 24 hours at 4c from blood drawing they are affected by transportation and biological variability is not high in general it could be remarked however that the intra individual variability is high when compared with other haematological parameters such as haemoglobin and haematocrit the intervals of data reported in athletes are very similar to reference intervals characterizing the general population the reticulocyte count shows some modifications after training and during the competition season the variability induced by exercise cannot be overlooked since the so called haematological passport a personal athletes document in which haemoglobin and other parameters are registered may be introduced by sports federations exposure to naturally high altitude and living high training low programmes determined contentious results on reticulocytes simulated high altitude induced by intermittent hypobaric hypoxia does not modify reticulocytes despite an increase in erythropoietin serum concentration the variability among athletes competing in different sport disciplines is apparently limited the knowledge of the behaviour of reticulocytes in training and competitions is crucial for defining their role in an antidoping control context it is important for sport physicians and clinical pathologists to know the reticulocyte variability in the general population and in athletes the pre analytical warnings the different methodologies for counting reticulocytes and the derived parameters automatically available and finally the possible influence of training competitions type of sport and altitude author,Medicine
concussion is an injury to the brain occurring as the result of biomechanical forces generally characterized by the rapid onset of a constellation of symptoms or cognitive impairment which is typically self limited and resolves spontaneously concussion as the result of playing sports is particularly common estimated to occur up to 3 8 million times each year in the united states although most concussions can be considered benign the symptoms are often severe enough to interfere with daily function a small percentage of concussions can be more serious resulting in a prolonged symptom course significant morbidity or even death the management of concussion in the athlete presents a unique set of challenges for the clinician requiring not only a detailed neurologic history and examination but also careful consideration of an athlete s risk of further injury and possible long term sequelae author,Medicine

the purpose of this paper is twofold a to present data on racial differences in sport performance and b to comment briefly on theories hypotheses and studies whether they be biological psychological or sociological in nature that have attempted to explain the observed differences available data are mainly drawn from studies focusing on american professional sports the results indicate that afro american athletes largely dominate the sport scene in a few sports and across a wide range of performance indicators although it is impossible at this time to conclude with satisfaction on the causes of racial differences sociological explanations seem best to explain the observed performance differentials author,Medicine
in considering the nutrition for maximal sports performance only the carbohydrate stores are relevant to energy expenditure during training periods adequate supply of protein is a prerequisite in competition periods of less than 20 minutes duration normal glycogen stores in muscle tissue seem to be adequate but liver glycogen deficiency can limit the performance via a hypoglycemic effect on the central nervous system thus a carbohydrate rich diet should be given during the days before and between competition events with heavy exercise of longer duration it can be of value to increase the glycogen store in muscle groups performing the heaviest work this is achieved by first depleting muscles of glycogen through exercise and thereafter taking a diet rich in carbohydrate this regimen also increases the liver glycogen store author,Medicine
participation in sports has been a major pastime for americans in the last decade however it has now become an obsession obviously there are many possible causes for this craze or craving for exercise at least in part this popularization and commercialization of the beneficial effects of exercise are because of perceived health benefits 1 to date no definitive study has shown that regular exercise prevents coronary heart disease nevertheless there is a growing body of evidence from epidemiologic studies suggesting that regular exercise may help to prevent coronary hear t disease and reduce the incidence o f sudden death 2 7 however even the most faithful proponents of exercise admit that there are still uncertainties about the effect of exercise in altering the course of the disease in patients with known coronary heart disease and that myocardial ischemia cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death have been reported to occur more f requent ly dur ing vigorous exercise l s 9 probably the overall effect of habitual exercise is beneficial author,Medicine

the principle of training can be reduced to a simple dose response relationship the response in this relationship can be measured as a change in performance or the adaptation of a physiological system the dose of training or physiological stress associated with the training load is more difficult to measure as there is no absolute gold standard which can be used in the field making it difficult to validate procedures attempts have been made to use heart rate as a marker of intensity during training but the theoretical attractiveness of this method is not supported by the accuracy and the practicality of using this method during training or competition the session rpe based on the product of training duration and perceived intensity is more practical and can be used in a variety of sports however the score depends on a subjective assessment and the intersubject comparisons may be inaccurate the demands of different sports vary and therefore the methods of assessing training need to vary accordingly the time has come to reach consensus on assessing training accurately in different sports there is a precedent for this consensus approach with scientists having already done so for the assessment of physical activity and for defining injuries in rugby football and cricket standardizing these methods has resulted in the quality of research in these areas increasing exponentially author,Medicine
this article describes the physiologic and neural mechanisms that cause neuromuscular fatigue in racquet sports table tennis tennis squash and badminton in these intermittent and dual activities performance may be limited as a match progresses because of a reduced central activation linked to changes in neurotransmitter concentration or in response to afferent sensory feedback alternatively modulation of spinal loop properties may occur because of changes in metabolic or mechanical properties within the muscle finally increased fatigue manifested by mistimed strokes lower speed and altered on court movements may be caused by ionic disturbances and impairments in excitation contraction coupling properties these alterations in neuromuscular function contribute to decrease in racquet sports performance observed under fatigue author,Medicine
androgens remain the most effective and widely abused ergogenic drugs in sport although androgen doping has been prohibited for over 3 decades with a ban enforced by mass spectrometric ms based urine testing for synthetic and exogenous natural androgens attempts continue to develop increasingly complex schemes to circumvent the ban a prominent recent approach has been the development of designer androgens such never marketed androgens evade detection because mass spectrometry relies on identifying characteristic chemical signatures requiring prior knowledge of chemical structure although once known designer androgens are readily detected and added to the prohibited list however until their structures are elucidated designer androgens can circumvent the ban on androgen doping to combat this in vitro androgen bioassays offer powerful new possibilities for the generic detection of unidentified bioactive androgens regardless of their chemical structure another approach to circumvent the ban on androgen doping has been the development of indirect androgen doping the use of exogenous drugs to produce a sustained increase in endogenous testosterone t production apart from estrogen blockers however such neuroendocrine active drugs mostly provide only transient increases in blood t finally the ban on androgen doping must allow provision for rare athletes with incidental proven androgen deficiency who require t replacement therapy the therapeutic use exemption mechanism makes provision for such necessary medical treatment subject to rigorous criteria for demonstrating a genuine ongoing need for t and monitoring of t dosage effective deterrence of sports doping requires novel increasingly sophisticated detection options calibrated to defeat these challenges without which fairness in sport is tarnished and the social and health idealization of sporting champions devalued author,Medicine

every fifth unintentional injury treated at a healthcare facility in the industrialised part of the world is associated with sports or physical exercise this article reviews the literature regarding the theoretical and practical underpinnings for community based sports safety promotion including both professional and recreational sports while injury prevention entails the implementation of specific interventions in terms of structural or educational measures sports safety promotion includes also the antecedent and wider campaigns that are required to succeed with these measures comprehensive sports safety promotion programmes thus require that the perspective on the sports injury problem is made broader than consideration of the individual athlete the results display that involvement in sports safety issues from the sports federations that formulate policies and allocate resources is necessary for coordinated implementation of programme actions the authorities responsible for sports facilities and legislations in the civil society also need to be included because of the fact that they control many of the central safety determinants in the sporting environment it is concluded that the sports injury problem needs to be addressed in liaison with the leaders of socially defined sports communities and the governments representing geographically defined civic communities and that the safety supporting environment in professional sports is underdeveloped compared with other areas of working life author,Medicine
use of performance enhancing supplements occurs at all levels of sports from professional athletes to junior high school students although some supplements do enhance athletic performance many have no proven benefits and have serious adverse effects anabolic steroids and ephedrine have life threatening adverse effects and are prohibited by the international olympic committee and the national collegiate athletic association for use in competition blood transfusions androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone are also prohibited in competition caffeine creatine and sodium bicarbonate have been shown to enhance performance in certain contexts and have few adverse effects no performance benefit has been shown with amino acids beta hydroxy beta methylbutyrate chromium human growth hormone and iron carbohydrate electrolyte beverages have no serious adverse effects and can aid performance when used for fluid replacement given the widespread use of performance enhancing supplements physicians should be prepared to counsel athletes of all ages about their effectiveness safety and legality author,Medicine
in order to assess the extent of the sports injury problem it is necessary to identify both the incidence and severity of sports injuries in the literature the severity of sports injuries is usually described on the basis of 6 criteria i nature of sports injury ii duration and nature of treatment iii sporting time lost iv working time lost v permanent damage and vi monetary cost it is important to include information on the severity of injuries in a sports injury registration system this kind of information will help to set targets for preventive strategies the more severe the injuries sustained the higher the priority will be to prevent these injuries regardless of the injury incidence when assessing injury severity one should take into account that in order to enhance the comparability of research data uniform definitions are also important in this area of sports injury surveillance this paper briefly discusses the 6 criteria used to describe the severity of sports injuries author,Medicine

diagnostic ultrasound has in recent years been shown to be an extremely versatile and cost evective tool in the assessment of a wide range of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases for superficial soft tissue structures such as the achilles patellar rotator cuv and plantar aponeurotic tendons high resolution high frequency diagnostic ultrasound in the hands of an appropriately trained sonologist has a greater spatial and contrast resolution than magnetic resonance imaging until recently the ultrasound systems capable of producing the required image quality were the top of the range units costing around 80 000 120 000 it is important to realise however that a number of manufacturers flagship systems although expensive are unable to provide good images for musculoskeletal ultrasound conversely certain ultrasound equipment manufacturers have now started to develop dedicated portable musculoskeletal systems for a quarter to a third of this price dynamic imaging limited livingston uk for instance will be launching early in 1998 their application specific ultrasound systemsthat is the diasuswith one of these systems being specifically modified and targeted at the musculoskeletal ultrasound market also interestingly it was recently announced by one large manufacturer from the usa that they will be releasing in the next two years a pocket unit which by the year 2005 may have a similar image quality to current high resolution systems like many things in life it is not necessarily size that counts musculoskeletal ultrasound is able to be used to distinguish between chronic tendinitis bursitis and tenosynovitis paratendonitis to classify and quantify the extent of muscle injury to evaluate joint dynamic and often static stabilisers and to assess joint synovitis or fluid it is also able to identify the precise site of superficial soft tissue inflammatory processes for localisation of therapeutic modalities and direct needle placement for aspiration or local anaesthetic corticosteroid infiltration perhaps even more important in chronic repetitive minor injury overuse phenomena is the fact that musculoskeletal ultrasound is able to identify precise patterns of disease and therefore provide information about the underlying injury mechanismthat is it is not only able to demonstrate the cause of an athletes symptoms but the cause of the cause the fact that the imaging method is sensitive enough to demonstrate subclinical soft tissue degenerative changes and that there is no ionising radiation involved means that ultrasound may also be used as a screening procedure in an attempt to diagnose and correct underlying biomechanical faults before they even produce symptoms it may also be used for follow up studies to assess the eycacy of therapeutic regimes the dedicated musculoskeletal ultrasound systems currently being developed are being aimed at the rheumatology orthopaedic sports medicine and possibly physiotherapy markets an increasing number of individuals involved in musculoskeletal imaging believe that in five years time when possible tendon muscle and superficial ligament soft tissue injuries are being considered the clinical examination process will be look feel move ultrasound therefore if the most useful role for musculoskeletal ultrasound is in the clinic setting as an extension of physical examination it would appear to be logical that either the ultrasound investigation should be performed by a radiologist with appropriate clinical experience in musculoskeletal injury and disease or a clinician physiotherapist with appropriate ultrasound training and experience indeed in many countries throughout the worldfor example spainmost musculoskeletal ultrasound is performed by rheumatologists or sports physicians the only important consideration should be that a patient athlete receives the most cost evective high quality care possible in the current health economic climate when considering medicolegal liability for therapeutic errors based on musculoskeletal ultrasound performed by non radiologists the situation is slightly unclear certainly many orthopaedic surgeons and rheumatologists perform their own arthrography discography etc so presumably a legal precedent exists also as musculoskeletal ultrasound in other eec countries is performed regularly by non radiologists european law must have a precedent perhaps anyone considering performing musculoskeletal ultrasound should however initially consult their trust or insurance organisation about their liability again the important factor would seem to be the level of training and experience achieved in the diagnostic range ultrasound itself is inherently safe the health risks from ultrasound relate to misdiagnosis and not any radiation produced integral to the expansion of musculoskeletal ultrasound is therefore the quality of training provided in the use of the technique recent negotiations have taken place with a number of the manufacturers interested in expanding the musculoskeletal ultrasound market with regard to the incorporation of training and in service clinical support within the equipment purchase price in order to help maintain appropriately high imaging standards optimisation of imaging standards would seem to be in everyones interest whether the imager clinician the manufacturer or most importantly the patient such considerations are important as in diagnostic ultrasound the correct scanning technique is just as important as a knowledge of anatomy and pathology and image interperation skills if diagnostic errors are to be avoided as we enter the newmillenium if the expansion of musculoskeletal ultrasound is correctly controlled in terms of education and training it could become one of the most valuable tools in the armamentarium of all involved in the prevention assessment and rehabilitation of sports injuries author,Medicine

men generally have an inherent performance advantage over women due to their average greater height and muscle mass and power as the result of correspondingly different exposures to androgens therefore it is considered fair that in sports men and women compete in separate categories the question now emerging is whether reassigned transsexuals can compete in fairness with others of their new sex the pertinent question is how far the previous effects of testosterone in male to female transsexuals m f are reversible upon androgen deprivation so that m f have no advantage over women and vice versa what the effects are of androgen exposure in female to male transsexuals f m on variables relevant to competition in sports before puberty boys and girls do not differ in height muscle and bone mass recent information shows convincingly that actual levels of circulating testosterone determine largely muscle mass and strength though with considerable interindividual diversity this study analyzed the effects of androgen deprivation in 19 m f and of androgen administration to 17 f m on muscle mass hemoglobin hb and insulin like growth factor 1 igf 1 before cross sex hormone administration there was a considerable overlap in muscle mass between m f and f m in both m f and f m height was a strong predictor of muscle mass androgen deprivation of m f decreased muscle mass increasing the overlap with untreated f m but mean muscle mass remained significantly higher in m f than in f m androgen administration to f m increased muscle mass without inducing an advantage over nontreated m f the conclusion is that androgen deprivation in m f increases the overlap in muscle mass with women but does not reverse it statistically the question of whether reassigned m f can fairly compete with women depends on what degree of arbitrariness one wishes to accept keeping in mind for instance that similar blood testosterone levels in men have profoundly different biologic effects on muscle properties rendering competition in sports intrinsically a matter of how nature endows individuals for this competition author,Medicine

motor racing is one of the most physically and mentally challenging of all sports not only for racing drivers themselves but also for the teams that play an integral role in the eventual performance of the car it is my belief that for such a demanding and popular sport sports medicine is seriously underused drivers and teams are faced with continuous pressure to perform yet have far less involvement with sports medicine staff than many olympic athletes tennis professionals and footballers of all codes particularly from a preventive perspective in this article i will outline some of my experiences as a sport psychologist and fitness consultant with racing car drivers and teams identifying some of the challenges in a growing field n nbefore going into detail it should be noted that motor sports has depth well beyond formula one for example motor racing is a major sport in the united states with nascar cart world series and the indy racing league to name but a few in europe there is formula 3 formula 3000 and rallying in asia there is also a huge number of categories in many countriesfor example in australia alone there is the shell touring car series formula holden formula ford gtp and nations cup series and in other parts of asia the asia pacific rally series and the japanese sports car series coexist n nin almost all of the categories identified above particularly formula one motor racing drivers must execute numerous motor and cognitive skills simultaneously they must remain calm and focused on their vehicle s performance the track and their competitors only centimetres away while travelling at speeds of 150300 km per hour they must also manoeuvre gears and foot pedals while steering their vehicle using highly developed coordination each movement must be rapid and precise during this author,Medicine

physicians have struggled with the medical ramifications of athletic competition since ancient greece where rational medicine and organized athletics originated historically the relationship between sport and medicine was adversarial because of conflicts between health and sport however modern sports medicine has emerged with the goal of improving performance and preventing injury and the concept of the team physician has become an integral part of athletic culture with this distinction come unique ethical challenges because the customary ethical norms for most forms of clinical practice such as confidentiality and patient autonomy cannot be translated easily into sports medicine the particular areas of medical ethics that present unique challenges in sports medicine are informed consent third parties advertising confidentiality drug use and innovative technology unfortunately there is no widely accepted code of sports medicine ethics that adequately addresses these issues author,Medicine
there is increasing concern that too much physical activity may lead to osteoarthritis the continuous stress that physical activity places on the joints can result in microtrauma and degeneration of the articular cartilage however the onset of osteoarthritis appears to depend on the frequency intensity and duration of physical activity research has shown that individuals of all ages can tolerate moderate amounts of exercise without adverse consequences or accelerated development of osteoarthritis however excessive participation in high impact sports particularly over a long period of time and at an elite level can increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis participants may also be at risk if they have abnormal joint anatomy or alignment joint instability underlying muscle weakness or imbalance or if they are overweight and engage in significant amounts of exercise individuals who have experienced sports injuries to joints or macrotrauma may also be at risk of accelerated development of osteoarthritis certain types of surgery for the treatment of severe sports injuries particularly to the knee also appear to be associated with an increased risk if surgery to the knee is required continuous passive motion is an ideal form of rehabilitative treatment as it promotes healing of the articular cartilage ligaments and tendons moreover athletes who have undergone surgery should return slowly to sporting activities to ensure they do not place too much stress on their injured joint s further research into the causes of osteoarthritis is required in particular prospective and retrospective cohort studies are needed to confirm the association between exposure to risk factors and the development of osteoarthritis author,Medicine
sweat losses during team sports are influenced by the intermittent nature of the work rates high intensity exercise interspersed with low level activity and both formal and informal rest periods and a high level of inter and intra individual variability in workloads since many team sports have evolved in countries with cool climates traditions and rules governing the time of play duration of play without a break and the type of uniforms may lead to inappropriately high thermal stresses when these sports are played in hot environments i e gt 25 degrees c 60 relative humidity fluid intake during team sports is largely determined by opportunities to drink during formal rest periods and during informal stoppages in play present regulations concerning fluid breaks in some sports may be inappropriate if fluid requirements of players competing in hot environments are to be met to prevent hypohydration and fatigue nevertheless it appears that in most team sports there are adequate opportunities for players to keep fluid deficits below 2 of body mass studies across a number of sports show that mean fluid intakes of up to 1000 ml h 1 can be achieved strategies are required to help team sport players realize the importance of optimal hydration and to use or create opportunities within their sport to maximize fluid intake guidelines for hydration during training and competition are suggested with the proviso that these should be adapted for each individual and his or her own sport author,Medicine

summaryteam sports require players to perform multiple work bouts at near maximal effort punctuated with intervals of low intensity exercise or rest for the duration of a game such activity patterns are associated with a significant loss of body water which has a negative impact on physical and mental performance as well as temperature regulation there are a number of ways in which sweat losses incurred during team sports differ from those measured during prolonged continuous exercise firstly the work rate in team sports is intermittent largely unpredictable and random in nature second analyses of various team sports reveal that such games are characterised by a high degree of inter and intra individual variability in work rates between players from the same sport finally team players are less able to anticipate sweat losses than athletes competing in events which involve prolonged continuous moderate intensity exercise yet compared with most endurance events many team sports offer frequent opportunities to ingest adequate volumes of fluid and thus prevent exercise induced hypohydration the present review details the findings of modern studies which have determined body water losses and fluid intake practices of athletes from a variety of team sports special considerations which influence sweat loss and fluid intake that are unique to team sports are discussed and guidelines for sound hydration strategies during training and competition are provided author,Medicine
increasing participation and training intensity in sports and physical activity has resulted in an increasing number of injuries as well as recognition of new injuries improved diagnostic techniques such as mri ct scan scintigraphy and ultrasound have proven to be valuable in the diagnosis of especially soft tissue injuries surgery is today generally accepted as the treatment of choice for anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the active population arthroscopic reconstruction using the bone patellar tendon bone graft is considered to be the gold standard alternative grafts such as semitendinosus and gracilis can also be used the use of artificial ligaments and allografts is still experimental most posterior cruciate ligament injuries are today treated conservatively and so are ankle ligament injuries there is still no final solution how to treat articular cartilage lesions although interest is being focussed on cartilage resurfacing overuse tendon injuries often become chronic and are then associated with persistent structural alteration chronic overuse injuries are characterized by a failure to develop adequate scar tissue restoration the reason for this delayed healing is still unclear the treatment of these injuries include today early strength and stretching training but the main concepts are still controversial due to lack of scientific evidence our understanding of shoulder injuries in athletes has developed enormously during the last few years the use of arthroscopy when performing subacromial decompression and surgery of labral tears have allowed more athletes to return early to sports than before laboratory studies have increased our understanding of muscle injuries and they show the importance of early mobilization prevention will be a major issue for research within the next decade it is the author s opinion that within the next decade sports traumatology will take a leading role in orthopaedic and sports medicine research author,Medicine

summarymuch has been written about the evaluation and management of mild brain trauma in sports no less than 10 different guidelines have been proposed and published to aid the clinician in the diagnosis of this condition too often these guidelines have creating confusion instead of promoting an understanding of the spectrum of brain injury as the understanding of the basic science of mild brain injury evolves so must the approach to the concussed athlete this article presents an up to date and clinically useful approach to the management of the athlete with a mild brain injury the definition of concussion is discussed and clarified and pertinent epidemiological data which highlight the importance of management skills as applied to athletes in a wide variety of sports are also reviewed there is really no such thing as a mild concussion if one considers the rare but catastrophic outcome of the second impact syndrome for this reason we review and expand upon the mechanisms of injury and pathophysiology the accurate diagnosis of mild brain injury requires considerable experience a high index of suspicion a careful history and a series of examinations of the athlete and a working knowledge of the athletes personality and the likelihood of minimising their symptoms the value of orientation questions pertinent to the athlete is now well established any focal neurological deficit or the deterioration of an athletes condition warrants immediate hospitalisation brain imaging and neurosurgical consultation more commonly athletes present with a brief alteration of consciousness headache and amnesia and require careful examination and observation before returning to competition the astute clinician will always err on the side of conservative management the complete resolution of all symptoms before a return to play is imperative computerised tomography is very sensitive in the imaging of mild brain injuries neuropsychological testing is also very sensitive in the evaluation of brain injuries in athletes and may become more clinically useful in the future author,Medicine
as sports scientists we claim to make a significant contribution to the body of knowledge that influences athletic practice and performance is this the reality at the inaugural congress of the australian association for exercise and sports science a panel of well credentialed academic experts with experience in the applied environment debated the question does sports science research influence practice the first task was to define sports science research and it was generally agreed that it is concerned with providing evidence that improves sports performance when practices are equally effective sports scientists also have a role in identifying practices that are safer more time efficient and more enjoyable there were varying views on the need for sports science research to be immediately relevant to coaches or athletes most agreed on the importance of communicating the results of sports science research not only to the academic community but also to coaches and athletes and the need to encourage both short and long term research the panelists then listed examples of sports science research that they believe have influenced practice as well as strategies to ensure that sports science research better influences practice author,Medicine

summaryduring the past 20 years there have been great developments in the scientific understanding of the role of nutrition in health and physical performance epidemiological and physiological studies have provided evidence that certain forms of dietary behaviour may be linked with an increased risk of developing disorders such as high blood pressure coronary artery disease and some cancers this has resulted in dietary recommendations that are intended to reduce the incidence of these disorders in the community the science of nutrition in relation to sports performance has progressed from empirical studies investigating the effects of dietary manipulations such as restriction and supplementation to the direct investigation of the physiological basis of the specific nutritional demands of hard physical exercise this review is based on the premise that it is what comes out rather than what goes in which provides the clues to ideal nutrition for athletic performance various aspects of the physical demands of athletic exercise are viewed as stresses that induce specific biochemical and hence nutritional strains in the athlete training is the predominant demand in the athletic lifestyle this is characterised by acute bouts of high power output during one hour of hard training an athlete may expend 30 of his or her total 24 hour energy output these high power outputs have important implications for energy substrate and water requirements carbohydrate specifically muscle glycogen is an obligatory fuel for the high power outputs demanded by athletic sports muscle glycogen is a limiting factor in hard exercise because it is held in limited amounts utilised rapidly by intense exercise and fatigue occurs when it is depleted to low levels in the active muscles liver glycogen may also be exhausted by hard exercise and low blood glucose contributes to fatigue high sweat rates are demanded during severe exercise and large water deficits commensurate with energy expenditure are incurred during extended periods of hard training and competition salt potassium and magnesium are lost in nutritionally significant amounts in the sweat but vitamins and trace elements are not adaptive mechanisms protect athletes against electrolyte depletion iron loss in sweat may contribute to the iron deficiency seen in some endurance runners protein is degraded and amino acids are oxidised during physical exercise protein is also retained during muscle building training recent investigations indicate that the minimal protein requirements of athletes may be substantially higher than those for sedentary persons nonetheless all the protein that athletes need will be supplied by a conventional diet and protein supplements are not required there is no evidence that athletes have extraordinary vitamin requirements some endurance runners adolescent and female athletes are at risk of iron depletion with or without obvious anaemia these people require nutritional counselling and may benefit from supervised iron supplementation the major nutritional demands arising from hard athletic exercise are for carbohydrate and water liberal carbohydrate and water consumption is essential for full recovery between training sessions and in preparation for competition the pre competition meal provides limited benefits other than promoting full hydration large intakes of simple carbohydrates close to competition may precipitate hypoglycaemia and impair performance during exercise water consumption to replace sweat losses is the major concern the formulation of nutritional guidelines for athletes based on the physiological demands of athletic exercise indicates that the ideal dietary pattern for athletes coincides in most repects with internationally recognised recommendations for a healthy diet a review of the limited published information on dietary habits of athletes indicates that in general they do not select diets that promote either good health or optimal performance author,Medicine
optimal nutrition is a critical component of growth and development but also plays an integral role in sports performance the young athlete who is not well fueled or hydrated may experience defi cits in strength speed and stamina as well as decreased focus increased fatigue and increased risk of injury however the message about eating needs to be pertinent to young athletes otherwise it goes unheeded a focus on nutrition is not as accepted as an emphasis on performance the goal of sports nutrition is to help keep athletes playing their sport to do this young athletes need to learn not only what to eat and drink but why when and how much they should consume in addition it is in the athletes best interest to educate the family parents grandparents guardians about fuel for sport team physicians should schedule a time to talk with their teams in advance during and after the regular season about the importance of proper hydration and fueling or better yet enlist the expertise of a sports dietitian as part of a comprehensive sports exam it is important to ask questions of the athlete and or caregiver you can have the athlete or his her parent caregiver to fi ll out a nutrition assessment form in ad1 identify an effective means to assess the nutritional status of a young athlete during the offi ce visit author,Medicine
musculoskeletal sonography has been shown to be effective for many applications related to sports medicine some advantages of sonography over mr imaging include portability accessibility high resolution and relative lower cost more importantly dynamic imaging under sonography visualization allows diagnoses that cannot be made with routine mr imaging additionally direct imaging correlation with patient symptoms provides important information to the referring clinicians the disadvantages of sonography include operator dependence and long learning curve this can be minimized however with proper training and standardized technique musculoskeletal sonography has proved itself as one of several imaging methods invaluable to the diagnosis of sport medicine related abnormalities author,Medicine

one of the biggest challenges facing numerous young athletes is attempting to perform safely and effectively in the heat an even greater performance challenge and risk for incurring exertional heat injury is encountered when a young athlete has to compete multiple times on the same day with only a short rest period between rounds of play during a hot weather tournament within the scope of the rules tournament directors frequently provide athletes with only the minimum allowable time between same day matches or games notably prior same day exercise has been shown to increase cardiovascular and thermal strain and perception of effort in subsequent activity bouts and the extent of earlier exercise heat exposure can affect performance and competition outcome incurred water and other nutrient deficits are often too great to offset during short recovery periods between competition bouts and the athletes are sometimes forced to compete again not sufficiently replenished providing longer rest periods between matches and games can significantly improve athlete safety and performance by enhancing recovery and minimizing the carryover effects from previous competition related physical activity and heat exposure that can negatively affect performance and safety governing bodies of youth sports need to address this issue and provide more specific appropriate and evidence based guidelines for minimum rest periods between same day contests for all levels of tournament play in the heat youth athletes are capable of tolerating the heat and performing reasonably well and safely in a range of hot environments if they prepare well manage hydration sufficiently and are provided the opportunity to recover adequately between contests author,Medicine

summarythe possibility that men might masquerade as women and be unfair competitors in womens sports is accepted as outrageous by athletes and the public alike since the 1930s media reports have fuelled claims that individuals who once competed as female athletes subsequently appeared to be men in most of these cases there was probably ambiguity of the external genitalia possibly as a result of male pseudohermaphroditism nonetheless beginning at the rome olympic games in 1960 the international amateur athletics federation iaaf began establishing rules of eli gibility for women athletes initially physical examination was used as a method for gender verification but this plan was widely resented thus sex chromatin testing buccal smear was introduced at the mexico city olympic games in 1968 the principle was that genetic females 46 xx show a single x chromatic mass whereas males 46 xy do not unfortunately sex chromatin analysis fell out of common diagnostic use by geneticists shortly after the international olympic committee ioc began its implementation for gender verification the lack of laboratories routinely performing the test aggravated the problem of errors in interpretation by inexperienced workers yielding false positive and false negative results however an even greater problem is that there exist phenotypic females with male sex chromatin patterns e g androgen insensitivity xy gonadal dysgenesis these individuals have no athletic advantage as a result of their congenital abnormality and reasonably should not be excluded from competition that is only the chromosomal genetic sex is analysed by sex chromatin testing not the anatomical or psychosocial status for all the above reasons sex chromatin testing unfairly excludes many athletes although the ioc offered follow up physical examinations that could have restored eligibility for those failing sex chromatin tests most affected athletes seemed to prefer to retire all these problems remain with the current laboratory based gender verification test polymerase chain reaction based testing of the sry gene the main candidate for male sex determination thus this advance in fact still fails to address the fundamental inequities of laboratory based gender verification tests the iaaf considered the issue in 1991 and 1992 and concluded that gender verification testing was not needed this was thought to be especially true because of the current use of urine testing to exclude doping voiding is observed by an official in order to verify that a sample from a given athlete has actually come from his or her urethra that males could masquerade as females in these circumstances seems extraordinarily unlikely screening for gender is no longer undertaken at iaaf competitions author,Medicine
rolling over sitting up pulling to a stand these activities are all developmental milestones with which parents and physicians are well familiar but the developmental highway does not stop after potty training baby books may not have any further guidance but it is critical to understand how young bodies continue the process of acquiring different skills that apply to sports and exercise activities throughout childhood and early adolescence knowledge of sports skill development in youngsters may help dampen much of the significant pressure placed upon kids today to start competing at younger and younger ages much of the pressure today stems from unrealistic expectations placed upon young children these unrealistic expectations often are caused by a lack of knowledge of what skills they may be able to do appropriately or of the sequential maturation process of skills required for sports many adults may think that once a child can run any other skills improve out of sheer repetition and practice hence the disconnect between expectation and reality the exciting world of how children improve certain skills happens along a sequential pattern that is consistent for most children v but occurs at different speeds and matures to different levels among them to make things even more complex the various aspects of physical visual physiologic and psychologic development mature at different rates having a clearer picture of this process hopefully will allow adults to reduce the pressure placed upon youngsters to perform skills for which they may not be developmentally ready this reduced pressure could then allow more children to reach more of their potential with much less stress this is a goal in line with supporting children to have fun be active and create positive life long views of exercise and fitness early sports specialization pressure to perform winning at any cost these are the signs of the times success needs to be redefined because our current societal definition is one reserved only for the gold medalist or the first place finisher unfortunately that leaves very little room for any child or adult to experience the joy of success and subjects them more to the agony of defeat however in reality success would dictate that personal improvement or personal accomplishment absolutely is a successful and worthy outcome this approach is beneficial if we wish to reduce the number of cases of youths leaving sports because of burnout certainly there are children who have extraordinary talents and perform outside the box of standard developmental skills but those children are the exceptions rather than the rule when a youngster has a phenomenal ability he or she should be encouraged and supported to proceed in a healthy way as to prevent overuse injuries or burnout instead many parents and coaches try to push their youngsters to achieve that extraordinary ability at an even younger age this approach can be unhealthy and can lead kids to specialize too early in a particular activity have recurrent overuse injuries or succumb to the effects of pressure and prematurely quit their sport it behooves us as health care professionals to guide parents and coaches into better awareness of the navigation process of the hills and curves of the developmental highway in my book sports success rx v your childs prescription for the best experience american academy of pediatrics 2006 i remind adults that even when superman was a boy he did not just step into his cape v he had to grow into it many toddlers and young children are still processing how to run without falling down due to the maturation of their proprioceptive and balance skills they also are easily distracted and require unstructured activities this combination alone will often frustrate many parents who are yelling from the sidelines to get the ball when the child has stopped to appreciate an ugly bug on the grass visual skills move along a fascinating path requiring a toddler to have a stationary object for hitting a ball such as in t ball and then progressing in childhood to catching kicking hitting a ball coming right at them to eventually being able to run and meet a moving object at another location this visual maturation process occurs in a sequence over time and most children cannot be expected to acquire such skills all at once physiologic development speeds along at its own pace and kids involved in aerobic activities appear to have limited ability to greatly improve their aerobic capacity until they enter puberty this timing means that many youngsters may author,Medicine

carnitine has important roles in skeletal muscle bioenergetics skeletal muscle carnitine deficiency is associated with profound impairment of muscle function it has thus been natural to ask if carnitine supplementation can improve skeletal muscle function and athletic performance in healthy individuals oral carnitine doses of several grams cause no significant clinical toxicity further encouraging the use of carnitine as a supplement despite this strong foundation and 20 years of research no compelling evidence exists that carnitine supplementation can improve physical performance in healthy subjects the available data have been reviewed in recent publications several key issues are relevant to a potential therapeutic benefit of carnitine supplementation and addressing these may provide insight into trials of carnitine therapy in healthy subjects 1 can carnitine supplementation increase skeletal muscle carnitine content in healthy subjects muscle carnitine content is not easily increased with carnitine supplementation this reflects both the systemic pharmacokinetics of carnitine and the systems controlling transmembrane transport of carnitine in skeletal muscle 2 how much carnitine is required to support optimal metabolism in skeletal muscle data are not available to definitively define the relationship between muscle carnitine content and muscle metabolic function extrapolation of data from several models suggests that very low amounts of carnitine are required to support muscle function 3 does carnitine supplementation alter energy homeostasis in healthy subjects several but not all studies suggest that subjects on carnitine supplementation have altered regulation of fuel homeostasis however the mechanisms of these changes the tissues affected and the relevance of these phenomena to exercise performance are all ill defined 4 how can changes in performance be assessed in healthy subjects most studies have failed to demonstrate an objective performance improvement in healthy subjects taking carnitine however these negative studies must be interpreted with caution performance studies in athletes are conducted against a background of aggressive training regimens and nutritional interventions small changes which may be very important to the athlete may be very hard to objectify in the laboratory assessments must differentiate between changes in maximal aerobic capacity ability to sustain effort at varied workloads and the subject s perception of exertion the interaction of carnitine supplementation with exercise training may be particularly important on theoretical and experimental bases systematic research in each of these areas is required to better understand the physiology biochemistry and pharmacology of carnitine supplementation while data do not allow a conclusion to be drawn that carnitine is beneficial the negative has not been proven either author,Medicine

of exercise induced intimal fibrosis affecting mainly the iliac artery and therefore usually described as external iliac artery endofibrosis has dramatically changed the diagnostic approach of unexplained recurrent lower limb exercise pain especially in cyclists because arterial disease is often associated with the aftereffect of various concomitant musculotendinous lesions several months may pass before an arterial origin is suspected the arterial origin of the pain must not be eliminated on normal ankle to arm index or normal doppler velocity profiles at rest ultrasound examinations taken at rest may show the lesions in 80 of endofibrotic patients and allow for the diagnosis of popliteal entrapment syndrome during dorsiflexion of the foot however the hemodynamic consequences of a stenosis on the aortoiliofemoral axis can only be proved by measurement of the ankle to arm index after exercise a cutoff of this index lt 0 5 provides an 85 sensitivity in the detection of endofibrosis invasive investigations arteriography or angioscopy will confirm the diagnosis before surgery is discussed although long term results in endofibrosis are unknown most of the surgically treated patients return to competition author,Medicine

caffeine is the most widely ingested psychoactive drug in the world as many know chronic use of caffeine leads to dependence tolerance drug craving and upon abrupt cessation unpleasant withdrawal symptoms thus caffeine fulfills pharmacological criteria by which agents are classified as drugs of abuse nevertheless its use is legal and only at high but readily attainable levels is it banned from sport its use is widespread by athletes as young as 11 years of age who are seeking athletic advantage over fellow competitors it is likely that its use will not decline any time soon because it is inexpensive readily available medically quite safe socially acceptable and by most measures legal however at levels allowed in sport caffeine through its wide ranging physiological and psychological effects increases endurance in well trained athletes if the goal of drug testing and education programs in sport is to protect the health of athletes prevent unfair advantage cheating and encourage ethical behavior then it seems obvious that the allowable levels of caffeine ingestion should be decreased the alternative is to continue with policies designed largely to punish only those that get caught author,Medicine

abstractrecent studies have shown that endurance overtraining could result from successive and cumulative alterations in metabolism which become chronic during training the onset of this process is a biochemical alteration in carbohydrate saccharide metabolism during endurance exercises the amount of saccharide chains from two blood glycoproteins 2 macroglobulin and 1 acid glycoprotein was found to have decreased i e concentrations of these proteins remained unchanged but their quality changed these saccharide chains were probably used for burning liver glycogen stores during exercise this step was followed by alterations in lipid metabolism the most relevant aspect of this step was that the mean chain length of blood fatty acids decreased i e the same amount of fatty acids were found within the blood but overtrained individuals presented shorter fatty acids than well trained individuals this suggests that alterations appeared in the liver synthesis of long chain fatty acids or that higher peroxidation of blood lipoparticles occurred for the final step of this overtraining process it was found that these dysfunctions in carbohydrate lipid metabolism led to the higher use of amino acids which probably resulted from protein catabolism the evolution of three protein concentrations 1 acid glycoprotein 2 macroglobulin and igg3 correlated with this amino acid concentration increase suggesting a specific catabolism of these proteins at this time only overtraining was clinically diagnosed through conventional symptoms therefore this process described successive alterations in exercise metabolism that shifted from the main energetic stores of exercise carbohydrates and lipids towards molecular pools proteins normally not substantially used for the energetic supply of skeletal muscles now a general biochemical model of the overtraining process may be proposed which includes most of the previously identified metabolic hypotheses n author,Medicine

a plethora of investigations examining fluid intake before during and after training and competition have suggested that a lack of adequate fluid intake will impair or decrease physical performance depending upon the type of training or competition individuals training for prolonged endurance events should drink fluids containing carbohydrates and electrolytes during and after training or competition inadequate hydration will cause significant decrements in performance increase thermal stress reduce plasma volume accelerate fatigue and possibly cause injuries associated with fluid and sweat loss however overdrinking may cause na depletion and in some cases lead to hyponatremia maintaining proper hydration before during and after training and competition will help reduce fluid loss maintain performance lower submaximal exercise heart rate maintain plasma volume and reduce heat stress heat exhaustion and possibly heat stroke author,Medicine
bone scintigraphy is one of the mainstays of molecular imaging it has retained its relevance in the imaging of acute and chronic trauma and sporting injuries in particular the basic reasons for its longevity are the high lesional conspicuity and technological changes in gamma camera design the implementation of hybrid imaging devices with computed tomography scanners colocated with the gamma camera has revolutionized the technique by allowing a host of improvements in spatial resolution and anatomical registration both bone and soft tissue lesions can be visualized and identified with greater and more convincing accuracy the additional benefit of detecting injury before anatomical changes in high level athletes has cost and performance advantages over other imaging modalities the applications of the new imaging techniques will be illustrated in the setting of bone and soft tissue trauma arising from sporting injuries author,Medicine
rehabilitation of a knee injury is done in a criterion based progression that is based on individual progress from one phase to another and not on a prespecified period of time if the rehabilitation deviates from this approach the body will react with adverse affects such as inflammation pain and further injury delay in the entire rehabilitation program will delay the athlete in meeting goals and returning to play phase i focuses on restoration of range of motion pain modulation inflammatory control modification of activities and gait training phase ii is characterized by gaining full range of motion demonstration of normal gait pattern basic to advanced strengthening and flexibility appropriate cardiovascular conditioning and proprioception retraining phase iii allows functional return to prior activity level this phase includes a sport occupational specific functional progression utilizing a trained rehabilitation specialist will allow the athlete individual an effective and efficient return to prior level of function author,Medicine

creatine supplementation improves repetitive short term performance it has not been shown that exclusion of meat from the diet would impair repetitive short term performance in contrast reduction of protein intake and a concomitant increase of carbohydrate intake during a period of 35 days improves anaerobic 27 minutes performance the protein intake in a mixed or lacto vegetarian diet is adequate even for elite athletes providing that energy requirements are met many dietary supplements have been suggested to increase muscle mass and or to decrease fat mass although the effects of conjugated linoleic acid on body composition in athletes are not clear some positive findings in untrained obese individuals call for more studies strenuous training may impair immune function and increase the susceptibility to infections exclusion of meat from the diet does not seem to have adverse effects on immune function glutamine supplementation gt 36 g day may improve immune function but more studies are needed similarly more studies on the possible effects of whey protein and probiotic supplementation on immune function and performance in physically highly active individuals are warranted vitamin and mineral balance are not usually a problem among athletes notable exceptions may be calcium and iron in some females increased calcium intake in athletes with hormonal and menstrual disturbances could theoretically help in maintaining bone status however no data are available a diet with meat may help in maintaining adequate iron stores author,Medicine

spinal manipulation or manual therapy is becoming an increasingly popular method of treating athletes with spinal problems the primary theoretic basis for the claimed beneficial results of manipulation is the restoration of motion with subsequent effect on ligamentous adhesions muscle spasm disk nutrition and central nervous system endorphin systems the concept of joint barriers has been developed to differentiate among exercise therapy mobilization and manipulation research trials suggest that spinal manipulation is beneficial in relieving or reducing the duration of acute low back pain and acute neck pain but has much less effect on chronic low back pain and neck pain there is evidence that manipulation increases certain parameters of motion of the spine but this evidence is not yet conclusive there are a wide variety of manipulative procedures that are utilized to manipulate the spine to increase range of motion and the selection of the procedures is based on manual diagnostic skills manipulation however is not a benign procedure and has been implicated in the aggravation of disk herniation or bony fractures as well as the precipitation of vertebrobasilar artery occlusion author,Medicine
tennis is a popular racquet sport played by boys girls men and women tennis players frequently begin playing in childhood and may continue playing into late adulthood preadolescent and adolescent players have open growth plates and a reduced muscle power lower level of coordination and smaller stature compared with adult players the physical characteristics of the young tennis player mean that unique demands are placed on the developing athlete which can in turn be associated with different types and patterns of injury the most common types of injury in tennis players of all ages are muscle sprains and ligament sprains secondary to overuse these are a particular problem in the adolescent age group because in general this group begin playing with a lower level of physical conditioning fortunately injuries in younger players are usually not longstanding and the overuse chronic problems seen in older players such as patellar tendinosis and tennis elbow are less common in younger players anatomically lower extremity injuries are twice as common as those to the upper extremity or spine with ankle injury being the most common prevention of injury in young tennis players or at least a reduction in the incidence is possible some traumatic injuries including contusions abrasions lacerations and fractures may be unavoidable as a result of aggressive play but others may be prevented by monitoring equipment and the court surface to ensure a safe field of play the prime target of prevention in young tennis players should be overuse injuries the principles of overload and staged involvement are of particular importance in this age group a gradual progressive increase in the intensity of tennis practice the slow introduction of new court surfaces and a staged progression in the teaching of tennis skills can help to reduce the incidence of injury in young tennis players author,Medicine

author s schloss karen b advisor s palmer stephen e abstract the experiments described here were aimed at characterizing people s aesthetic responses to color pairs both in terms of which colors people prefer in combination and how the spatial organization of the component colors influences pair preference previous studies of preference for and harmony of color combinations have produced conflicting results for example some claim that harmony increases with hue similarity whereas others claim that it decreases in the first set of experiments we argue that such conflicting results are resolved by distinguishing among three types of judgments about color pairs a preference for the pair as a whole b harmony of the pair as a whole and c preference for its figural color when viewed against its colored background empirical support for this distinction shows that pair preference and harmony both increase as hue similarity increases but preference relies more strongly on component color preference and lightness contrast although pairs with highly contrastive hues are generally judged to be neither preferable nor harmonious figural color preference ratings increase as hue contrast with the background increases the present results thus refine and clarify some of the best known and most contentious claims of color theorists in the second set of experiments we investigated how spatial organization influences color pair preference asymmetries differential preference for one color pair over another when the pairs contain the same colors in opposite spatial configurations we found robust preference asymmetries in which participants strongly preferred pairs with yellower lighter figures on bluer darker grounds we also investigated which spatial factors influence these preference asymmetries relative area of the two component regions is clearly important and relative surface based area i e after amodal figure ground completion is more influential than relative image based area surroundedness is not required because yellowness blueness effects were comparable for figure ground pairs in which the figure was surrounded by the ground and for mosaic arrangements in which the regions were adjacent and separated by a gap lightness darkness effects however were in the opposite direction for figure ground versus mosaic organizations people prefer figure ground organizations in which the smaller regions are lighter but prefer mosaic organizations in which the smaller regions are darker we provide possible phenomenological and ecological explanations for the reported results author,Art
people with normal trichromatic color vision experience variegated hue percepts under dim illuminations where only rod photoreceptors mediate vision here hue perceptions were determined for persons with congenital color vision deficiencies over a wide range of light levels including very low light levels where rods alone mediate vision deuteranomalous trichromats deuteranopes and protanopes served as observers the appearances of 24 paper color samples from the osa uniform color scales were gauged under successively dimmer illuminations from 10 to 0 0003 lux 1 0 to 3 5 log lux triads of samples were chosen representing each of eight basic color categories red pink orange yellow green blue purple and gray samples within each triad varied in lightness observers sorted samples into groups that they could categorize with specific color names above 0 5 log lux the dichromatic and anomalous trichromatic observers sorted the samples into the original representative color groups with some exceptions at light levels where rods alone mediate vision the color names assigned by the deuteranomalous trichromats were similar to the color names used by color normals higher scotopic reflectance samples were classified as blue green grey and lower reflectance samples as red orange color names reported by the dichromats at the dimmest light levels had extensive overlap in their sample scotopic lightness distributions dichromats did not assign scotopic color names based on the sample scotopic lightness as did deuteranomalous trichromats and colour normals we reasoned that the reduction in color gamut that a dichromat experiences at photopic light levels leads to a limited association of rod color perception with objects differing in scotopic reflectance author,Art

a spectral based imaging system was constructed consisting of a two sequential absorption filter cfa digital camera and a seven color inkjet printer and used to image and print a post impressionist style painting such that matches were generated for cie illuminants d65 and a camera calibration was learning based using the matrix r method rendered images for both illuminants were inputted to a color separation algorithm first conventional colorimetric gamut mapping was performed for the designated primary illuminant second each pixel was transformed into a metameric printer gamut that is all possible ink combinations matching the primary illuminant the ink combination with the smallest color difference for the secondary illuminant was selected as the color separation prints were prepared for each combination of primary and secondary illuminant and repeated for both cie standard observers the method was successful within limits of camera and printer spectral accuracy ink design and illuminant and observer metamerism introduction reproducing the appearance of paintings in print is a common occurrence in most museums visual editing is an integral part of the workflow 1 the amount of visual adjustment and the number of iterations required to achieve acceptability depends principally on the spectral properties of the artwork the spectral sensitivities and color management of the camera differences between the actual and assumed viewing illuminants differences in size between the original and reproduction the spectral properties of the printing materials and color management and the matching objective colorimetric preferred etc if the painting and print have the same size and matching is desired for multiple conditions spectral reproduction becomes the matching objective this objective has been achieved in the past using a multi spectral camera and spectral printing models 2 5 the limiting factor was the extreme computational load in generating color separations because in essence instrumental based color matching using non linear constrained optimization was performed at each pixel during the last years there have been significant advances in spectral imaging of artwork 6 spectral processing 7 9 and spectral printing 10 these references are exemplars and not a definitive list although these advances overcome the processing limitations of past research spectral reproduction of artwork is still limited by metamerism a result of printing inks inability to span the spectral properties of artist materials thus it was of interest to evaluate spectral color reproduction of a painting with a focus on metamerism experimental the general methodology is shown in figure 1 a painting is imaged using a multi spectral camera following spectral and spatial processing denoising and sharpening two cielab images are rendered for a standard observer and for primary and secondary illuminants the coordinates for the primary illuminant are mapped within the printers color gamut for each pixel all ink combinations and their amounts are calculated yielding a metameric ensemble of spectra metameric mismatch gamut for the secondary illuminant this is possible when the number of inks exceed three for each metamer a color difference is calculated for the secondary illuminant the ink combination leading to the smallest difference is selected figure 1 experimental workflow yellow indicates imaging system and blue indicates printing system painting a set of artist acrylics were defined that reasonably spanned the spectral gamut of artist pigments 11 these were used to make a painting in the style of vincent van goghs church at auvers shown in figure 2 imaging system a 22 megapixel sinar digital camera system was modified as described by berns 12 resulting in a six channel multispectral camera lighting consisted of two tungsten halogen elinchrom scanlite digital 1000 sources affixed with chimera diffusers lee 201 bluish gelatin filters were placed between the lamps and diffusers to achieve more spectrally uniform lighting cct 5400 k each light illuminated the object plane at 45 from the normal images were collected of a gray surface for flat fielding a gretagmacbeth colorchecker dc ccdc and a custom artist material target for calibration and the painting 484 2008 society for imaging science and technology a learning based technique known as the matrix r method was used to estimate spectral reflectance 13 this method optimizes colorimetric and spectral accuracy simultaneously accordingly transformations were derived for illuminants d65 and a and for both the 1931 and 1964 standard observers thus four 16 bit cielab images were rendered sharpening was performed on the l plane and noise was reduced on the a and b planes figure 2 auvers bernard lehmann 16 x 20 2007 rendered for d65 and the 1931 standard observer measurement locations notated printing system an hp z3100 photo inkjet printer was controlled by an onyx production house rip 7 0 of its 12 inks only cyan magenta yellow black red green and blue were used to reduce fluorescence in the final prints a paper without optical whitener was used felix schoeller h74261 270g m2 a calibration target of 7725 patches spanning the printers spectral gamut and constrained to the papers ink limits was printed and measured using an x rite i1isis the ink gamut was divided into four ink sub gamuts 2 and the cellular extension of the yule nielsen spectral neugebauer equations was used to characterize each spectral sub gamut in similar fashion to chen 14 the separation method combined spectral gamut mapping as well as model inversion in one single step the basis of the separation is the spectral gamut mapping framework described in detail in another cgiv 2008 paper 15 the separation method compensated for both color discrimination and printing quantization artifacts using a traditional gamut mapping chroma compression while preserving hue and lightness within a hue linearized 16 cielab color space for the primary illuminant the cielab image was transformed into a metameric printer gamut a 3d histogram was created for this image and for each sub model the colorant space was sampled in 1 steps resulting in 100 million different ink combinations for the 20 sub models a total of 2 billion colors were transformed by the forward model for the primary illuminant and tested using the 3d histogram for matching pixel cielab values of the already gamut mapped image for each ink combination matching a cielab pixel value for the primary illuminant the corresponding cielab value for the second illuminant was calculated using the forward printer model and compared with the corresponding pixel cielab value for the second illuminant using e00 the ink combination with the smallest difference was used for the separation the whole separation process required 5 min for a 22 megapixel image on an intel q6600 quad core processor using a performance optimized c implementation results and discussion the spectral reflectance factors of fifteen positions selected as representative colors were measured using an x rite i1 on the painting and each print the metameric mismatch gamuts for illuminant a secondary illuminant are plotted in figure 3 for seven of the colors that did not overlap in the a b projection for some colors e g blue and greenish yellow the color of the painting was not within the mismatch gamut thus it was not possible to produce a reproduction matching the painting except under a single reference condition the spectral properties of the printer did not span the acrylic paints in particular ultramarine blue the dominant paint used in the sky this is shown in figure 4 position 8 the prints had different spectral characteristics than the painting although the printers blue ink has a long wavelength reflectance tail it did not coincide with ultramarine and the spectral differences beyond 600 nm are striking another example is the greenish yellow used between the split in the road position 14 hansa yellow medium with a transition wavelength above 500 nm was redder than the printer yellow having a transition wavelength near 480 nm consequently the print was metameric an example of good performance is shown in figure 6 for a grayish green color position 6 for each measurement position the print spectra exhibited similar shape with appreciable variation the color separation algorithm resulted in the same set of inks for each color but a range of ink amounts this was caused by changes in the primary and secondary illumininants changes in the observer and measurement uncertainty caused by positioning the spectrophotometer figure 3 metameric mismatch gamuts for seven

in a photographic system the random variations in otherwise uniform responses to exposing light are referred to as grain this two dimensional random noise is characterized objectively by the rms granularity the subjective impression of this noise is termed graininess bartleson demonstrated that a logarithmic relationship exists between the rms print granularity and perceived graininess as measured on an interval scale subsequently maier and miller described the first grain ruler a technique whereby graininess can be measured or visualized quickly and directly although observers were able to successfully use this technique to directly measure graininess large interobserver variability was found in actual use in this paper we explain the source of this variability and present an improved grain ruler for use with color reflection materials the kodak color grain ruler created via digital image simulation techniques allows the direct measurement of the graininess of color reflection prints with a minimum of interobserver variability the kodak color grain ruler has applications for both conventional photographic prints and within certain limitations the assessment of two dimensional random noise in digitally generated reflection prints author,Art

lindsey and brown 2002 proposed an intriguing explanation for the existence and geographical distribution of languages that lack a distinct word for the color blue many such languages include blue in a color term that also encompasses green yielding a green or blue grue term others include blue in a color term that also encompasses dark colors such as black yielding a black or blue dark term lindsey and brown proposed that grue and dark terms result from exposure to high levels of ultraviolet b uv b radiation from sunlight this uv b radiation leads to accelerated yellowing of the ocular lens and a resultant distortion of perceptual color space so that blue stimuli appear greenish or dark in the extreme case and are thus named by the word for green or dark this is lindsey and browns lens brunescence hypothesis lbh in support of the lbh lindsey and brown demonstrated that the proportion of languages having a term for grue or dark as opposed to a distinct blue term is well predicted by the amount of uv b radiation from sunlight that strikes the earths surface where these languages are spoken they also demonstrated that english speaking subjects exposed to stimuli that simulate the result of accelerated lens yellowing in a high uv b environment extend the term green to include the color blue the lbh is potentially controversial for at least two reasons first there is evidence for perceptual processes that at least partially compensate for increases in ocular media density delahunt webster ma werner 2002 kraft werner 1999 thus lens yellowing may not substantially affect color perception in the long term second there is evidence that languages lacking a term for blue tend to be spoken in societies with a low level of technological development and these societies are often located in the tropics where uv b is strongest berlin kay 1969 hays margolis naroll perkins 1972 kay maffi 1999 naroll 1970 hence lindsey and browns correlation between uv b and no blue term could be an artifact of the link between low technology and no blue term consequently a further test of the lbh seems to be in order the lbh makes a prediction concerning which colors should be chosen as the best examples of grue terms cross linguistically if grue terms are simply terms for green that extend to blue because of a distortion of perceptual color space there should be a single peak in the distribution of choices of best examples of grue and it should fall somewhere between green and blue if in contrast grue terms do not result from a perceptual distortion but rather are genuine abstractions over green and blue in an undistorted perceptual color space the best examples of grue terms should lie at either green or blue or both lindsey and brown acknowledged these issues p 510 and also acknowledged impressionistic findings suggesting that best examples of grue may in fact cluster near focal green and blue however they did not seem to acknowledge that such findings if more firmly empirically established would constitute a direct challenge to their theorynot just a limitation maclaury 1997 pp 234235 demonstrated that in mesoamerican languages the best examples of grue terms tend to fall near green and blue we were interested in determining whether this pattern held in a broader language sample the world color survey wcs kay berlin maffi merrifield 1997 data now available on line at http www icsi berkeley edu wcs data html contains color naming data from 110 unwritten languages worldwide from an average of 24 native speakers per language mode 25 speakers each speaker named each of the color chips shown in the stimulus array at the top of figure 1 these chips were presented in a fixed random order each speaker then also viewed the entire array and selected the best example or examples of each of his or her major color terms we focused on those speakers in the wcs who provided the same name effectively grue for central green central blue and all chips in between central green and central blue were taken to be the centroids of naming responses for the english terms green and blue respectively obtained from sturges and whitfield 1995 we then examined these speakers best example choices for grue and counted how many such choices hits fell in each cell of the stimulus array in the top panel of figure 1 the single highest peak of the resulting distribution is at j0 the blackest chip in the array 87 hits the bottom panel of figure 1 shows the distribution of hits across the chromatic colored cells of the array there are peaks at english green green and peak both at f17 79 hits and near english blue blue at f27 peak at f29 45 hits this distribution suggests that grue terms tend not to be perceptual distortions of green but rather genuine abstractions over green and blueand black thus these findings are evidence against the lbh some investigations have suggested a whorfian effect of color language on color cognition

this paper describes a new approach for book recognition where color images of the spines of books are analyzed to identify books displayed on book shelves first edges of hsy images are unified to one edge image considering the color features of the spines of each book the color information in the images is effective for segmenting images to robustly extract book boundaries the approach may resolve the edge extraction problem that occurs in analyzing grayscale images then book title character string regions are extracted using a min max filter the filter enables us to extract the regions while avoiding the effects of shading distribution due to non uniform lighting and the convex surfaces of book spines in the last step the cumulative projection profile of each title character string region is compared with that in a database and the title can be determined without having to recognize each character one by one the approach presented in this paper makes it possible to visually inspect book shelves and paves the way for the development of an automated system for managing books in bookstores libraries storerooms and offices author,Art

adding rgb inks to the traditional set of cmyk inks increases the attainable color gamut but the added complexity poses a challenge in generating suitable separations for rendering of color images the approach taken in this study reduces the dimensionality of the problem by subdividing the 7 inks into smaller groupings a series of 4 ink subsets from the 7 ink superset of cmykrgb were individually characterized and a colorimetric transform from ink to color was obtained for each subset in color space the 4 ink subsets represent adjacent and overlapping subgamuts of the 7 ink gamut by utilizing these characterizations both individually and in combination with one another an inktable which transforms color to ink was generated in the darker tonal region 4 inks color permits access to regions of the full 7 ink gamut which are inaccessible to schemes employing 3 inks color 1994 copyright spie the international society for optical engineering downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only author,Art

a fundamental feature of normal color vision is that red and green lights can be mixed to appear identical with a monochromatic yellow light another characteristic of normal color vision is that people often disagree on the amounts of red and green needed in the mixture to exactly match the yellow comparison of such color vision differences with photopigment gene differences reveals that a serine alanine polymorphism at amino acid position 180 of x encoded pigments can account for this type of color vision variation this amino acid change shifts the spectrum of the pigment produced by about 6 nm a value that would predict a larger minimum color vision difference between individuals than is actually observed this discrepancy can be explained if counter to the young helmholtz theory as the explanation of trichromacy many people with normal color vision have more than three spectrally different cone pigments author,Art
with the emergence of blue noise halftoning as a preferred halftoning technique the issues of moire patterns in conventional ordered dither color halftoning are replaced by new issues concerning the quality of overlaid blue noise patterns the goal of blue noise mask design in color halftoning is to generate a set of blue noise masks that produce high quality blue noise patterns whether they are used individually or jointly we first address this question by inspecting various combinations of unstructured binary patterns then explore the elementary properties of combinations of blue noise binary patterns based on the above analysis an algorithm using filter techniques is proposed this algorithm generates a set of jointly blue noise masks jbnm and each mask of the jbnm will be applied to one color plane the jbnm possesses the properties such that each individual mask is blue noise also the combination of the masks produce color images with blue noise characteristics e g the dots from different color planes are mutually exclusive and maximally dispersed at highlight levels examples of halftoned color patches using jbnm and other schemes are illustrated the evaluation demonstrates that jbnm can produce high quality color halftone patterns with little texture and graininess author,Art

denture bases may undergo color change over time induced by pigment accumulation within their body however there is a lack of information regarding the role of yerba mate tea in this process this work evaluated the effect of five common beverages including yerba mate tea on color changes of acrylic denture base resins processed in three different ways three different processing techniques were used p1 microwave irradiation microwave activated resin p2 heat polymerization conventional heat activated resin and p3 microwave irradiation conventional heat polymerized resin to make twenty five resin discs each 3 0 mm thick x 20 mm diameter totaling seventy five resin discs the discs made with each technique were randomly divided into five groups n 5 and placed in the following solutions g1 water g2 cola g3 coffee g4 yerba mate tea g5 red wine for 30 days at 37 degrees c the solutions were renewed every 3 days color change on the cie l a b scale was measured with a konica minolta cr 10 colorimeter and compared with original l a and b values of each specimen prior to immersion data were analyzed using 2 way anova and showed no difference among techniques and significant statistical differences among solutions p lt 0 05 tukey s post hoc test showed that the lowest color changes were for water and cola which were undistinguishable from each other coffee produced the second lowest color change yerba mate tea produced second greatest color change while the greatest color change was produced by red wine within the limitations of this study it was concluded that almost all the solutions used can change color in acrylic resin especially yerba mate tea considered distinguishable by professionals and red wine considered distinguishable by patients and clinically unacceptable author,Art
the image on a book cover gives potential buyers not only an impression of the books contents but also a clue for search and browsing before or after buying the book we propose using a color extraction method as the first step in automatically creating book cover images that reflect readers impressions we constructed a database expressing the relationships between adjectives and colors and extracted colors from text such as sentences in the book and user reviews in an experiment with 20 participants who were tasked with reading a book writing a review of the book and drawing an image of the book cover we demonstrated that the colors extracted using this method were more consistent with the colors in the images drawn by the participants than the colors in the actual cover especially for novels regardless of the amount of text in the book author,Art
many people believe that in the future of high fidelity color reproduction a device independent color space dics will be used to represent color image information discussions of dics have focused on what cie color space is most appropriate as a standard how to calibrate input devices and how to characterize output devices however the definition of device independent color has aroused a great deal of confusion in the literature does it mean a device independent definition of color measurement does it mean a standardized color space such as a cie space does it mean a method of color transformation such as efi color does it mean automated no operator intervention color matching does it mean open system architecture does a dics truly represent color appearance does a dics guarantee device independency of color in other words is the device dependency of color related only to the color coordinates that are used if not where does device dependency come from and how does one deal with device dependency of color in dics in this paper i will address all these issues author,Art

this paper presents an approach for enhancing digital color images printed in halftoning the method which we call selective conditional enhancement has been applied with good results to enhance digital color images printed in halftone due to the repetitive nature of the process for image digitizing and the common structure of patterns used to create halftone in color images it has been observed that the alterations of pixel colors in general are also repetitive based on the frequency of occurrence of pixels of a given color and on the values of their red green blue rgb components we have defined eight heuristic rules in principle these rules define as valid those pixels having a high frequency of occurrence and as artifacts those with low frequency of occurrence the color of less frequent artifacts is then changed to some color of any more frequent valid pixel this approach based also on user defined essential colors generates images that are notably enhanced author,Art
color hardcopy output is subject to many of the same image quality concerns as monochrome hardcopy output line and dot quality uniformity halftone quality the presence and magnitude of bands spots or deletions are just a few examples of critical image quality attributes that are shared by both color and monochrome output although measurement of color requires the use of specialized instrumentation the techniques used to assess color dependent image quality attributes on color hardcopy output are based on many of the same techniques as those used in monochrome image quality quantification in this paper we will be presenting several different aspects of color quality control and measurement we will discuss the role of color image quality assessment in both r d and production environments as well as present several examples of color quality measurements that are similar to those currently being used at hewlett packard to characterize color devices and to verify system performance we will then discuss some important considerations for choosing appropriate color quality measurement equipment for use in either r d or production environments finally we will discuss the critical relationship between objective measurements and human perception author,Art

in any list of the attributes comprising that quality of the human hand described as lifelike color must occupy an important position it therefore seems reasonable that in the design of cosmetic gloves provision should be made for obtaining a duplication of the color of normal human hands that is as realistic as possible failure to do so may lead to a finished product having a wax museum look a dead look or a sick look 15 the problem of representation of human skin engaged the attention of the artist first just how representation was achieved is difficult to determine because the artistic expression of attaining the effects of flesh varies so greatly many procedures were followed and the use of several pigments became established very often the flesh tones in a painting are not dictated solely by the desire of the artist to duplicate realism but are modified to harmonize with the scheme of over all color composition in the development of portraiture however there was evolved during the fifteenth century a technique whereby the flesh areas were first undercoated with green or silvery tones of gray over this imprimatura were superimposed very thin layers of red yellow and white so as to cause a fusion of the different and delicate colors of the skin author,Art
this paper presents a new algorithm for color based tracking of objects with radical color using modified mean shift conventional color based object tracking using mean shift does not provide appropriate result when initial color distribution disappears in this proposed algorithm mean shift analysis is first used to derive the object candidate with maximum increase of density direction from current position then the proposed algorithm is used iteratively to update the object color information if the object color is changed the implementation of the new algorithm achieves effective real time tracking of objects with complete color changed by time the validity of the effective approach is illustrated by the presentation of experimental results obtained using the methods described in the paper author,Art

yeasts are predominant in the ancient and complex process of winemaking in spontaneous fermentations there is a progressive growth pattern of indigenous yeasts with the final stages invariably being dominated by the alcohol tolerant strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae this species is universally known as the wine yeast and is widely preferred for initiating wine fermentations the primary role of wine yeast is to catalyze the rapid complete and efficient conversion of grape sugars to ethanol carbon dioxide and other minor but important metabolites without the development of off flavours however due to the demanding nature of modern winemaking practices and sophisticated wine markets there is an ever growing quest for specialized wine yeast strains possessing a wide range of optimized improved or novel oenological properties this review highlights the wealth of untapped indigenous yeasts with oenological potential the complexity of wine yeasts genetic features and the genetic techniques often used in strain development the current status of genetically improved wine yeasts and potential targets for further strain development are outlined in light of the limited knowledge of industrial wine yeasts complex genomes and the daunting challenges to comply with strict statutory regulations and consumer demands regarding the future use of genetically modified strains this review cautions against unrealistic expectations over the short term however the staggering potential advantages of improved wine yeasts to both the winemaker and consumer in the third millennium are pointed out author,Art

different categories of finds reveal how neanderthals have manifested at different moments behaviors not ascribable to the utilitarian sphere but to the aesthetic or symbolic when the majority of this evidence dates to the few millennia that preceded the spread of anatomically modern humans in europe these are grounds to continue the debate regarding the emergence of complex behavior seen as an autonomous phenomenon of neanderthal man or as the result of contact with immigrant populations re examination of pebbles or flaked stones a large part of such evidence using a rigorous technological and taphonomic approach integrated with experimental tests has already revealed these materials to be insignificant or natural rather than anthropic in origin the following work seeks to shed light on the uncertainty existing around those stones and lithic artefacts bearing surface lines and scratches these are of doubtful anthropic origin but have not as yet been definitively interpreted generally these findings are occasional in mousterian sites and when they are recovered with an excellent degree of preservation different methods and levels of observation can be used for investigating them the case studies taken into account are three sites in north italy where the surfaces of pebbles and flakes reveal a variety of signs and modifications attributable to various utilitarian acts of these preventive cleaning of flint nodules has not been excluded even if the traces on some tools reveal intentionality and repetition of gestures applied to the construction of a curated artifact author,Art

to investigate the effect of competitive incentives under peer review we designed a novel experimental setup called the art exhibition game we present experimental evidence of how competition introduces both positive and negative effects when creative artifacts are evaluated and selected by peer review competition proved to be a double edged sword on the one hand it fosters innovation and product diversity but on the other hand it also leads to more unfair reviews and to a lower level of agreement between reviewers moreover an external validation of the quality of peer reviews during the laboratory experiment based on 23 627 online evaluations on amazon mechanical turk shows that competition does not significantly increase the level of creativity furthermore the higher rejection rate under competitive conditions does not improve the average quality of published contributions because more high quality work is also rejected overall our results could explain why many ground breaking studies in science end up in lower tier journals differences and similarities between the art exhibition game and scholarly peer review are discussed and the implications for the design of new incentive systems for scientists are explained author,Art

it was in his quartet for the end of time that olivier messiaen began a life long process of discovery not only into his inner world of colour but also into a sound world which eliminated conventional notions of musical time he regarded himself as a composer and rhythmatician and the task he set himself in his quartet was to produce a rhythmic system that could emulate the patterns of nature the apocalyptic inference of the quartet s title was deliberate it followed directly from the vision messiaen experienced when he was a prisoner of war in 1940 n nmy own visual interpretation of abime des oiseaux the 3rd movement of the quartet has been influenced by two key facts first messiaen s ability to see his own music and that of other composers in vivid colours secondly the life long inspiration that messiaen gained from the shimmering stained glass windows of chartres cathedral details of just one rose window have enabled me to interpret visually the extreme conflicts of mood conveyed by messiaen s music for the composer the angel who announces the end of time means the dissolution of musical time in a multitude of new rhythmic ways my aim has been to create a pattern book of images where each of messiaen s innovative rhythmic patterns has its visual counterpart to achieve this end i have explored new techniques and methods for producing visual music which seek to give some outward expression to the composer s apocalyptic vision author,Art
the expanding availability of high quality large scale data from the realm of culture and the arts promises novel opportunities for understanding and harnessing the dynamics of the creation collaboration and dissemination processes fundamentally network phenomena of artistic works and styles to this end in this paper we explore the complex network of western classical composers constructed from a comprehensive cd compact disc recordings data that represent the centuries old musical tradition using modern data analysis and modeling techniques we start with the fundamental properties of the network such as the degree distribution and various centralities and find how they correlate with composer attributes such as artistic styles and active periods indicating their significance in the formation and evolution of the network we also investigate the growth dynamics of the network identifying superlinear preferential attachment as a major growth mechanism that implies a future of the musical landscape where an increasing concentration of recordings onto highly recorded composers coexists with the diversity represented by the growth in the sheer number of recorded composers our work shows how the network framework married with data can be utilized to advance our understanding of the underlying principles of complexities in cultural systems author,Art

the authors created a dance workshop for schizophrenic patients designed to address their singular experience of space in which the categories of interior and exterior do not function as limits the space of the workshop which paradoxically is thought in terms of the psychic space of schizophrenic patients by playing on its borderless quality creates a continuity between the psychiatric hospital and the external world and thus helps to prevent the segregation and isolation of such patients this continuity is established on the basis of both the physical architecture of the workshop setting and the practice of dancing itself the authors explore the hypothesis that inside the particular space made possible by the apparatus of the workshop schizophrenic patients benefit from the experience of movement beginning with the pulse of rhythm which establishes a consistency in time by means of its repetitive character the beat of music like movement accompanies and promotes the experience of continuity which is the condition for any possible form of symbolizing two brief clinical illustrations show how this approach to dance therapy allows a moribund jouissance to be overturned and transformed into the aesthetic jouissance that characterizes the experience of dance author,Art

the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of digital radiographic display on caries detection and choice of treatment among undergraduate students forty images of extracted human teeth were acquired using a psp digital system the proximal surfaces were evaluated for the presence of proximal caries and choice of treatment by 36 undergraduate students divided into three groups according to the semester they were taking the images were evaluated in two forms of image display laptop and printed on acetate viewed on a lightbox the accuracy of the different forms of image display on caries detection was evaluated by means of roc curve analysis and its effect by mixed linear regression residue analysis was used to verify the adequacy of the treatment of choice for the chosen diagnosis there was no significant effect either for the display modalities p 0 058 or for the different undergraduate student groups p 0 991 the az was 0 539 for printed images and 0 516 for laptop the decisions based on treatment of choice were consistent with the scores achieved for caries detection accuracy of caries detection using a laptop was comparable to accuracy using printed images treatment decision was not affected by image display modality the semester of the dentistry course that undergraduate students were taking did not significantly increase the accuracy of their proximal caries detection author,Art
the development of the azilian in western europe 14 000 years ago is considered a revolution in upper paleolithic archaeology one of the main elements of this rapid social restructuring is the abandonment of naturalistic figurative art on portable pieces or on cave walls in the magdalenian in favor of abstract expression on small pebbles recent work shows that the transformation of human societies between the magdalenian and the azilian was more gradual the discovery of a new early azilian site with decorated stones in france supports this hypothesis while major changes in stone tool technology between the magdalenian and azilian clearly mark important adaptive changes the discovery of 45 engraved schist tablets from archaeological layers at le rocher de l impratrice attests to iconographic continuity together with special valorization of aurochs as shown by a shining bull depiction this evidence suggests that some cultural features such as iconography may lag far behind technological changes we also argue that eventual change in symbolic expression which includes the later disappearance of figurative art provides new insight into the probable restructuring of the societies author,Art
automatic photo aesthetic assessment is a challenging artificial intelligence task existing computational approaches have focused on modeling a single aesthetic score or a class good or bad however these do not provide any details on why the photograph is good or bad or which attributes contribute to the quality of the photograph to obtain both accuracy and human interpretation of the score we advocate learning the aesthetic attributes along with the prediction of the overall score for this purpose we propose a novel multitask deep convolution neural network which jointly learns eight aesthetic attributes along with the overall aesthetic score we report near human performance in the prediction of the overall aesthetic score to understand the internal representation of these attributes in the learned model we also develop the visualization technique using back propagation of gradients these visualizations highlight the important image regions for the corresponding attributes thus providing insights about model s representation of these attributes we showcase the diversity and complexity associated with different attributes through a qualitative analysis of the activation maps author,Art

artists have a specific evaluation of abstract paintings while art novices do that with difficulty this difference is shown in eye fixation patterns although the cause is not clear to explain the difference in fixation patterns we used one of the saliency maps of paintings which predict fixations well without prior knowledge such as a meaningful target if artists had a deep knowledge of art they attend less to the salient features than novices in observing abstract paintings on the other hand the fixation patterns possibly vary in visual tasks therefore we examined the effect of salient features in two tasks free viewing and preference judgment to evaluate this quantitatively the correlation coefficient cc between fixation distribution and a saliency map was used the ccs were compared between artists and novices for each task we found that the ccs of artists were lower than those of novices in the free viewing task but not in the preference judgment task this implies that the artist s knowledge of observation paintings was appeared only in free viewing author,Art

programming is often taught by having students do practical programming exercises from simple string reversal to search tree the examples and methods of teaching mimic the life of a professional programmer in a sense this leads to young children developing an idea of what programming is we found that children under 12 already have clear preconceptions of what programming is for can we design educational materials to battle this notion can we teach programming by using less traditional forms or viewing programming in this paper we describe a four part course called code as art art as code it uses poems and paintings to teach novices and experienced programmers to see source code differently in the first two lessons participants practice viewing source code as a poem or as a painting code as art in the other two they use source code to generate poems and paintings art as code we describe the scientific and creative rationale behind both and describe our experiences in teaching each of the four parts author,Art

the success of a movie is usually measured through its box office revenue or the opinion of professional critics but such measures may be influenced by external factors such as advertisement or trends and are not able to capture the impact over time of a film a more efficient measure should account to what extent a given movie has influenced other movies produced after its release from both the artistic and the economic point of view hence we propose a ranking method for movies based on the network of citations between them obtained by combining several centrality indexes we apply our method on a subset of the imdb citation network consisting of around 65 000 international movies and we derive a list of films that can be considered milestones in the history of cinema for each movie we also collect its year of release genres and countries of production and we analyze such features for finding trends and patterns in the film industry author,Art

wearable devices and new types of sensors make it possible to capture people behavior activity and potentially cognitive state in their daily life today those devices are mainly used for well being applications by recording and displaying people s activity some work have been published going a step further by inferring from the recorded signals the emotional state of individuals or group of people however the information provided and the way it is presented are still in their infancy with time lined graphs showing calories heart rate steps temperature and sometimes affective intensity n nin this paper we present an experiment done during the visit of different people in a museum of arts to capture the emotional impact of the exposed paintings we also propose an associated visualization of their emotional journey the emotion is here measured as the affective response to the paintings observation and the processing algorithm is based on an existing technique adapted to the particular case of different observation durations the visualization is based on a 3d map of the museum with different colors associated to the different paintings to get the emotional heat map of the museum more precisely the arousal dimension the validation has been done in the museum of arts at lyon france with 46 visitors for a total of 27 paintings exposed in three different rooms author,Art

in his seminal book on esthetics berlyne 1971 posited an inverted u relationship between complexity and hedonic tone in arts appreciation however converging evidence for his theory is still missing the disregard of the multidimensionality of complexity may explain some of the divergent results here we argue that definitions of hedonic tone are manifold and systematically examined whether the nature of the relationship between complexity and hedonic tone is determined by the specific measure of hedonic tone in experiment 1 we studied three picture categories with similar affective and semantic contents 96 affective environmental scenes which were also converted into 96 cartoons and 96 representational paintings complexity varied along the dimension of elements in a between subjects design each stimulus was presented for 5 s to 206 female participants subjective ratings of hedonic tone either beauty pleasantness or liking arousal complexity and familiarity were collected in three conditions per stimulus set complexity and arousal were positively associated in all conditions with the strongest association observed for paintings for environmental scenes and cartoons there was no significant association between complexity and hedonic tone and the three measures of hedonic tone were highly correlated all rs gt 0 85 as predicted in paintings the measures of hedonic tone were less strongly correlated all rs gt 0 73 and when controlling for familiarity the association with complexity was significantly positive for beauty rs 0 26 weakly negative for pleasantness rs 0 16 and not present for liking experiment 2 followed a similar approach and 77 female participants all non musicians rated 92 musical excerpts 15 s in three conditions of hedonic tone either beauty pleasantness or liking results indicated a strong relationship between complexity and arousal all rs gt 0 85 when controlling for familiarity effects the relationship between complexity and beauty followed an inverted u curve whereas the relationship between complexity and pleasantness was negative rs 0 26 and the one between complexity and liking positive rs 0 29 we relate our results to berlyne s theory and the latest findings in neuroaesthetics proposing that future studies need to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of hedonic tone in esthetic experiences of artforms author,Art

an improved understanding of glycosylation will provide new insights into many biological processes in the analysis of oligosaccharides from biological samples a strict regime is typically followed to ensure sample integrity however the fate of glycans that have been exposed to environmental conditions over millennia has not yet been investigated this is also true for understanding the evolution of the glycosylation machinery in humans as well as in any other biological systems in this study we examined the glycosylation of tissue samples derived from four mummies which have been naturally preserved the 5 300 year old iceman called oetzi found in the tyrolean alps the 2 400 year old scythian warrior and scythian princess found in the altai mountains and a 4 year old apartment mummy found in vienna austria the number of n glycans that were identified varied both with the age and the preservation status of the mummies more glycan structures were discovered in the contemporary sample as expected however it is significant that glycan still exists in the ancient tissue samples this discovery clearly shows that glycans persist for thousands of years and these samples provide a vital insight into ancient glycosylation offering us a window into the distant past author,Art

backgroundchildren with complex medical issues experience barriers to the transition of care from pediatric to adult providers we sought to identify these barriers by elucidating the experiences of patients with idiopathic inflammatory muscle disorders methodswe collected anonymous survey data using an online website patients and their families were solicited from the us and canada through established clinics for children with idiopathic inflammatory muscle diseases as well as with the aid of a nonprofit organization for the benefit of such individuals the parents of 45 older children young adults suffering from idiopathic inflammatory muscle diseases were surveyed as a basis of comparison we similarly collected data from the parents of 207 younger children with inflammatory muscle diseases the survey assessed transition of care issues confronting families of children and young adults with chronic juvenile myositis resultsregardless of age of the patient respondents were unlikely to have a designated health care provider assigned to aid in transition of care and were unlikely to be aware of a posted policy concerning transition of care at their pediatrician s office additionally regardless of age patients and their families were unlikely to have a written plan for moving to adult care conclusionswe identified deficiencies in the health care experiences of families as pertain to knowledge self advocacy policy and vocational readiness moreover as children with complex medical issues grow up parents attribute less self advocacy to their children s level of independence author,Art
digital altered photographs are now popular among artists due to advancements in digital technology manipulating or gathering pieces of images and combining them into one in computers artists who produce digital altered photographs not only deliver impressive technological effects for shock value but also and perhaps more importantly capitalize on the style s ability to express their particular messages to understand digital altered photographs and the messages behind them i propose that we start with investigating artists worldviews or what artists value as knowledge this inquiry can be achieved by asking about artists views of reality and by examining how their views of reality manifest in their digital altered photographs contemporary photographer matt siber and his digital projects floating logos and the untitled project provide an example of how investigating digital photographers views of reality and interpreting these views through theories can help us identify and clarify the valuable knowledge provided by their work author,Art
digital photo painting is a newly emerging phenomenon in both fine art and everyday life the latest versions of specialist software such as corel painter or adobe photoshop allow anyone to turn their selected photographs into enchanting paintings produced in any style desired the first book on this subject the art of digital photo painting by marilyn sholin was published quite recently in 2009 this paper explores the conceptual creative and cultural aspects of turning photos into paintings using popular software and plug ins it argues that the mass production of original digital paintings and fine art prints may signal a new era in the relationship between photography and painting the paper discusses why digital photo painting might be the next big thing in digital art and become a new hobby for millions author,Art
during the last decade technological improvements led to the development of large sets of plant genomic resources permitting the emergence of high resolution comparative genomic studies synteny based identification of seven shared duplications in cereals led to the modeling of a common ancestral genome structure of 33 6 mb structured in five protochromosomes containing 9138 protogenes and provided new insights into the evolution of cereal genomes from their extinct ancestors recent palaeogenomic data indicate that whole genome duplications were a driving force in the evolutionary success of cereals over the last 50 to 70 millions years finally detailed synteny and duplication relationships led to an improved representation of cereal genomes in concentric circles thus providing a new reference tool for improved gene annotation and cross genome markers development author,Art
gold and other alloys have long been used for the production of crowns and bridges as replacements for damaged or lost teeth however doubts have arisen on the suitability of using these materials for dental restorations as gold has also shown a capacity to cause side effects such as allergic reactions this is especially valid for alloys which during the last decades have been used as porcelain fused to metal restorations this fact has led to an interest in using titanium instead of these alloys trials to use titanium for this purpose were initiated in japan in the early 1980s titanium as an unalloyed metal differs in two aspects from the above named alloys it has a phase transformation at 882 degrees c which changes its outer and inner properties and it has an expansion that lies between that of the porcelain types available on the market at the time in japan a technique for casting titanium was developed where the after treatment of the casting was elaborate to re establish the original properties of titanium the porcelain developed for veneering had shortcomings as the rendering produced a rough surface and non satisfactory esthetics in sweden a new concept was introduced in 1989 here the processing of titanium was performed by industrial methods such as milling spark erosion and laser welding the idea behind this was to avoid phase transformation during the 1990s a number of porcelain products were launched and a vast number of both laboratory and clinical studies were performed and published with varying results in the first study of this thesis a prospective clinical trial was performed at a public dental health clinic in sweden twenty five patients were provided with 40 copings of pure titanium which were veneered with porcelain after 2 years 36 of these crowns were evaluated and the patients were also interviewed regarding problems such as shooting pains or difficulties in cleaning around the teeth that were crowned this evaluation showed generally unchanged values for color form surface and fit regarding surfaces one porcelain fracture was registered 3 the patient responses were positive and no case of sensitivity was reported after 2 years but in 3 cases food impaction was reported the second study is a systematic review of published articles on bond strength between titanium and porcelain the review made comparisons of bond strength using three point bending tests between different porcelain bonds to different alloys and to titanium between different brands of porcelain and titanium with porcelain following various types of processing of the titanium surface with different compositions of the porcelain and with different firing conditions generally it could be seen that with this type of test three point bending the bond strength between porcelain and titanium was lower than with alloys it was also seen that there are differences in bond strengths between different brands of porcelain that processing the titanium surface and composition of the porcelain affected bond strength and that firing conditions were also important the third study was performed with the intention of examining the firing accuracy of different types of dental furnaces and to investigate how maintenance and quality control is performed at swedish dental laboratories since titanium porcelain is fired at a temperature which is 200 degrees c below that used for most conventional alloys there are specific demands on the furnaces used the optimum firing temperature is judged to be 750 degrees c for porcelain veneering of titanium according to published studies in this study the real firing temperature at the holding period of 1 minute was recorded by a thermo element connected to a digital temperature measurement apparatus the accuracy of tested furnaces demonstrated a wide variation and in almost all cases the real temperature was higher than the temperature indicated by the furnace display in some cases this was very much higher than the temperature displayed this means a risk for an unwanted augmentation of the oxide layer on the titanium which could fracture on loading regarding maintenance and quality control interviews performed at 62 laboratories revealed that most of these did not attain the standards expected and claimed the fourth study was performed with the intention of studying how the bond strength between titanium and porcelain is affected by a temperature increase of 30 degrees c performed with two firing concepts for titanium porcelain and examined by three point bending tests the fractured surfaces were also analyzed with sem and edx these two concepts for titanium porcelain differ in that one has an oxide firing of the titanium metal as the first firing step while the other is fired with a bonding agent as the first step in the firing procedure furthermore half of the test bodies were aged by thermo cycling this study has shown that a moderate elevation in the firing temperature does not affect the bond strength in this case comparing bond strengths between the two different firing concepts three point bending tests showed that the test bodies that had undergone an oxidation firing had significantly higher bond strengths in all but one situation these results were contradicted by the sem and edx analysis these showed that with oxidation firing the fractures occurred in the brittle and probably thickened oxide layer of the titanium while the fractures occurred in the well integrated interface with titanium oxide and porcelain components when firing without oxidation the reasons for these contradictory results might be that oxidation firing changed the ductility of the titanium creating a higher stiffness which could better withstand the deflection of the specimens created during the three point bending tests for the same reason it might also be irrelevant to test bond strength between porcelain and metals with differing properties considering these results and the results from other studies the validity of the current test standard for metal ceramic bond strengths may be questioned author,Art
there are many architectural monuments and old relics the restoration of which is an unrealizable task this may be due to the great amount of hard work to be done complexity of the work lack of information about the object and other reasons in such cases the virtual reconstruction is an effective tool saint petersburg state university developed a method of restoration of partially or completely lost monumental paintings as an example and a practical application of new technology there was completed the virtual reconstruction of fresco paintings of the church of the transfiguration of our savior on nereditsa hill the church was almost completely destroyed during the second world war it appeared to be possible to reconstruct an architectural view of the church according to the old drawings but rare frescos of the xiith century had been irretrievably lost the extant parts of frescoes consist of 325 000 pieces although they are being on restoration now but this work is still far from completion in this case the method of computer based reconstruction is much more efficient it helps us to avoid mistakes and find a compromise decision on the issue of reconstruction or restoration of the object as a result of the project a fairly accurate reconstruction of the object has been produced and a method of reconstruction of the lost fresco painting has been developed the basis and sources of virtual reconstruction were archaeological materials archival and contemporary historical architectural and art papers scientific research in this field in the process of virtual reconstruction there were used two main methods a technology of computer graphics as well as analog pictorial reconstruction the first method makes it possible to complete the work of reconstruction with complete fidelity whereas the second method helps us to convey the artist s style to reproduce the form direction and strength of the artist s touch and texture of the frescos the results of the project can be used for further practical work for the restoration of the object the methodology developed by authors of the project may open new possibilities for the restoration of other fresco ensembles author,Art

one activity recognised as an interesting instance of creativity is the ability of poets to systematically come up with new poems irrespective of how many they have already written in the past poets who periodically produce a new poem different from the earlier ones and comparatively valuable are considered to embody a more interesting type of creativity than poets who have produced only one good poem in their lifetime or those that produce a succession of poems all built following a standard recipe so obvious that it can almost be described as a template this paper explores the constraints imposed on computational creative processes by the requirement of novelty with respect to previous outputs two issues emerge as fundamental how to evaluate novelty against a set of artifacts taken as reference and how to adjust construction procedures so that each successive run leads to significantly different output a possible modelling of these two issues is proposed in terms of two sets of sample artifacts a reference set against which novelty is measured and a learning set used to configure the construction procedures over this basic model extended discussion is carried out to draw out interesting insights for the design of computational creative systems author,Art

this paper addresses the problem of separating the illumination from the reflectance in images and compensating for non uniform lighting recorded images of mural paintings suffer from significant losses in visual quality compared to the direct eye observation when there are spatial or spectral variations in illumination the visibility of detail in shadows is poor for recorded images and therefore an automatic computation is needed to improve them for better optical investigation images of medieval mural paintings taken under very poor illumination conditions are processed by the biologically inspired retinex algorithm and by the equalize algorithm and the results are compared author,Art
analytic measurement of visual parameters relevant to the labial production of speech as well as real time 3d computer animated models of the lips and of the face have been implemented on two coupled computers so that synthetic lips alone or a whole facial model can mimic on line or play back the actual gestures of a natural speaker the geometric measurements performed on the speaker s lips and jaw are made through image processing of the front and profile view of the speaker s face data are transmitted to a display computer through a control interface which delivers the proper parameters to control the animation of the 3d models the lip model uses five control parameters and the facial model uses one extra one jaw lowering at present the tongue is not controlled we here present the realtime techniques used for analysis animation of the 3d models and synchronization of the two processes finally we evaluate the bimodal intelligibility of speech under five levels of acoustic degradation by added noise we compare the intelligibility of the speech signal presented alone with the lip model with the facial model and with the original speaker s face our results confirm the importance of visual information in the perception of speech the whole natural face restores two thirds of the missing auditory intelligibility when the acoustic transmission is degraded or missing the facial model tongue movements excluded restores half of it and the lip model alone restores a third of it author,Art

introduction the inherent beauty of science has recently become more accessible to the general public due to an escalation in the publication of multi color computer generated graphics images as well as photomi crographs and other images of scientific interest these images are appearing on the covers of many scientific and trade periodicals currently numbering over 250 where they serve as eye catchers to promote reader interest in addition scientific images now commonly appear in calendars and postcards designed both for commercial and consumer distribution as well as a wide variety of non scientific periodicals offered for sale to the general public photomicrography has recently enjoyed an escalation in popularity due in part to the introduction of new transparency films with improved emulsions and automated photomicrographic cameras an additional indicator of the expanded interest in photomicrogra phy is the increasing number of photomicrograph contests held each year both on a domestic and international basis author,Art
this paper describes musicream a novel music listening interface that lets a user unexpectedly come across various musical pieces similar to those liked by the user most existing query by example interfaces are based on similarity based searching so they return the same results for the same query meaning that a user of those systems always receives the same list of musical pieces sorted by similarity therefore most existing systems do not provide a user an opportunity to encounter various unfamiliar musical pieces by chance musicream facilitates active flexible and unexpected encounters with musical pieces by providing four functions the music disc streaming functionwhich creates a flow of many musical piece entities discs from a large music collection the similarity based sticking functionwhich allows a user to easily pick out and listen to similar pieces from the flow the meta playlist functionwhich can generate a playlist of playlists ordered lists of pieces and the time machine functionwhich automatically records all musicream activities and allows a user to visit and retrieve a past state as if using a time machine in our experiments these functions were used seamlessly to achieve active and creative querying and browsing of music collections confirming the effectiveness of musicream author,Art
we describe an agent based artist critic simulation artist agents use a swarm based evolutionary art system to evolve images that try to match their preferences preferred images are submitted to critic agents who then decide accordingly to their own criteria which images should be displayed in a public gallery the purpose of our model is to enable the implementation of a variety of behavioral policies which result in different dynamics a reward system determines the impact of each critic and the success of each artist which in turn leads to behavioral and preference changes the experimental results indicate the emergence of novel styles and trends artist critic cooperation and niche exploitation author,Art

young children tend to generalize novel names for novel solid objects by similarity in shape a phenomenon dubbed the shape bias we believe that the critical insights needed to explain the shape bias in particular and cognitive development more generally come from dynamic systems theory we present two examples of recent work focusing on the real time decision processes that underlie performance in the tasks used to measure the shape bias we show how this work and the dynamic systems perspective sheds light on the controversy over the origins and development of the shape bias in addition we suggest that this dynamic systems perspective provides the right level for explanations of development because it requires a focus on the details of behavior over multiple timescales author,Art
in this paper we analyze the evolution of van gogh s style toward the auvers final period using informational measures we will try to answer the following questions was van gogh exploring new ways toward changing his style can informational measures support the claim of critics on the evolution of his palette and composition how far was van gogh s last period from the previous ones can we find out an evolutionary trend we will extend here the measures defined in our previous work with novel measures taking into account spatial information and will present a visual tool to examine the palette our results confirm the usefulness of an approach rooted in information theory for the aesthetic study of the work of a painter author,Art
it has been known for more than 40 years that images fade from perception when they are kept at the same position on the retina by abrogating eye movements although aspects of this phenomenon were described earlier the use of close fitting contact lenses in the 1950s made possible a series of detailed observations on eye movements and visual continuity in the intervening decades many investigators have studied the role of image motion on visual perception although several controversies remain it is clear that images deteriorate and in some cases disappear following stabilization eye movements are therefore essential to sustained exoptic vision the time course of image degradation has generally been reported to be a few seconds to a minute or more depending upon the conditions here we show that images of entoptic vascular shadows can disappear in less than 80 msec the rapid vanishing of these images implies an active mechanism of image erasure and creation as the basis of normal visual processing author,Art
humans proneness to see faces even in inanimate structures such as cars has long been noticed yet empirical evidence is scarce to examine this tendency of anthropomorphism participants were asked to compare specific features such as the eyes of a face and a car front presented next to each other eye movement patterns indicated on which visual information participants relied to solve the task and clearly revealed the perception of facial features in cars such as headlights as eyes or grille as nose most importantly a predominance of headlights was found in attracting and guiding people s gaze irrespective of the feature they were asked to compare equivalent to the role of the eyes during face perception this response to abstract configurations is interpreted as an adaptive bias of the respective inherent mechanism for face perception and is evolutionarily reasonable with regard to a better safe than sorry strategy author,Art
to determine if the speaking fundamental frequency f0 profiles of english and mandarin differ a variety of voice samples from male and female speakers were compared the two languages f0 profiles were sometimes found to differ but these differences depended on the particular speech samples being compared most notably the physiological f0 ranges of the speakers determined from tone sweeps hardly differed between the two languages indicating that the english and mandarin speakers voices are comparable their use of f0 in single word utterances was however quite different with the mandarin speakers having higher maximums and means and larger ranges even when only the mandarin high falling tone was compared with english in contrast for a prose passage the two languages were more similar differing only in the mean f0 mandarin again being higher the study thus contributes to the growing literature showing that languages can differ in their f0 profile but highlights the fact that the choice of speech materials to compare can be critical author,Art
this paper presents a methodology for mapping the live sequence chart lsc language to an equivalent coloured petri net cpn model as an approach for analysis and verification of embedded systems properties lsc is a language for system specification allowing one to specify what should happen for all execution of the system as well as the modeling of anti scenarios however analysis and verification of systems properties are not possible in order to allow diagnosis of inconsistent specifications besides simulation verification and analysis should be considered therefore the proposition of a cpn model for lsc allows verification and analysis of systems described in lsc hence contributing for increasing designers confidence on the system development process and reducing risks that may lead to project failure author,Art
the english artist patrick hughes has created an extraordinary class of painted artpieces most commonly referred to as reverspectives they consist of truncated pyramids and prisms with their smaller faces closer to the viewer in such a way as to allow a realistic scene to be painted on them the works of art contain rich perspective and other painted cues that conspire to elicit an illusory depth percept that is the reverse of the physical depth arrangement this reverse depth is obtained under a wide range of viewing conditions and competes with the veridical depth percept in a classical bistable paradigm that was found to exhibit a high degree of hysteresis under the illusory depth percept reverspectives appear to move vividly as the viewer moves in front of them this paper reports two experiments that were designed to assess the effectiveness of the painted cues in eliciting the illusory depth percept by using three different measures for the strength of the illusion as expected the illusion was favored by monocular viewing and large viewing distances the results from these two experiments are in close agreement with each other and they indicate that the painted cues are powerful in influencing the ultimate percept author,Art

we present a novel spectral imaging technique that allows multiple gray scale images to be combined in a single hardcopy print the images are individually revealed when the print is illuminated by suitably chosen light sources in its basic form the technique utilizes the complementary relation between cyan magenta and yellow colorants and narrow band red green and blue illuminants to combine and extract the images instead of the conventional color imaging scenario where three dimensional color attributes of a print are controlled under a wide band illuminant using a set of colorants in illuminant multiplexed imaging one dimensional luminance attributes under two or more narrow band illuminants are simultaneously controlled using the same colorants we present a brief mathematical framework for illuminant multiplexed imaging and describe useful approximations that significantly simplify implementation several applications of the technology are presented author,Art

we show optical evidence that demonstrates artists as early as jan van eyck and robert campin c1425 used optical projections as aids for producing their paintings we also have found optical evidence within works by later artists including bermejo c1475 lotto c1525 caravaggio c1600 de la tour c1650 chardin c1750 and ingres c1825 demonstrating a continuum in the use of optical projections by artists along with an evolution in the sophistication of that use however even for paintings where we have been able to extract unambiguous quantitative evidence of the direct use of optical projections for producing certain of the features this does not mean that paintings are effectively photographs because the hand and mind of the artist are intimately involved in the creation process understanding these complex images requires more than can be obtained from only applying the equations of geometrical optics author,Art

pictorial relief depends strongly on cues in the image for isoluminant renderings some cues are missing namely all information that is related to luminance contrast e g shading atmospheric perspective it has been suggested that spatial discrimination and especially pictorial space suffer badly in isoluminant conditions we have investigated the issue through quantitative measurement of pictorial depth structure under normal and isoluminant conditions as stimuli we used monochrome halftone photographs either as such or transposed to red green or green red hue modulations we used two distinct methods one to probe pictorial pose by way of correspondences settings between pictures of an object in different poses the other to probe pictorial depth by way of attitude settings of a gauge figure to a perceptual fit in both experiments the depth reconstructions for red green green red and monochrome conditions were very similar moreover observers performed equally well in red green green red and monochrome conditions thus the general conclusion is that observers did not do markedly worse with the isoluminant red green and green red transposed images whereas the transposed images certainly looked weird they were easily interpreted much of the structure of pictorial space was apparently preserved thus the notion that spatial representations are not sustained under isoluminant conditions should be applied with caution author,Art

text quality of images output from printers is ve important in offices we supposed that the text qua lity has two aspects legibility and appearance and they s hould be evaluated individually however while a large number studies have been made on a text quality evalua technique there are few objective methods for prac purpose this paper describes our investigation of how evaluate legib ility of images from printers objectively first we supposed chinese character ka reproductivity as an evaluation parameter of legibility i represented by a size and strokes of chinese character reproduced well enough it is impossible to evaluate e ch of so many chinese characters therefore this method is effective for chinese characters also it is effective for other characters because chinese characters have structures than the other characters in general the primary purpose of this paper is to require quantitative evaluation technique of legibility we br ought an objective approach to the evaluation of legibility concentrated on line reproductivity and modulation tran function mtf the reason we chose them is that causes of deterioration of text are the breaks in lines an poor resolution of lines in general line reproductivity i parameter to show whether or not a line is reproduced enough we supposed an algorithm for measuring i consideration of human visual characteristic we studied correlation between legibility and each of them as a resul we found that we can predict legib il ty by better understanding and use of these two characteristics from the findings of these investigations it is cl that we can evaluate the legibility of images output fr printers quantitatively with a test target including plu patterns which vary in the line width or line width li pitch essentially author,Art
we are studying non photo realistic rendering npr with the goal of developing an image expression tool to create artworks by the npr technique the purpose of most npr researches is to simulate typical painting styles so they focus on techniques to create brushstrokes these superficially modified images cannot deviate far from the source photo if a rendered image is seen from a distance it is difficult to tell the difference from the source photo this fact makes us realize that other important elements to add artistic expression to the photographs exist we supposed that the distribution of bright and dark parts over the painting is essential and proposed the effective way to modify that our novel technique is based on knowledge about human optical illusions and basic visual design rules we integrate this technique into our npr system which was used to make the artworks selected by siggraph 2002 2d art gallery furthermore we present new features that allow artist to select appropriate area for extreme expressions to create many types of brushstrokes and to choose more than two types of brushstrokes for a single artwork author,Art
the acclaimed italian directors luchino visconti and federico fellini had very different life trajectories that led them to become major figures in the history of cinema similarities however can be found in their debuts with the neorealist genre their personalities creative styles and politicocultural involvement and ultimately in the neurological disease that struck them at the end of their careers both suffered a right hemispheric stroke that left them hemiplegic on the left side we review their life and career to put that event into perspective and then discuss its aftermath for both artists in the light of our current knowledge of right hemispheric functions visconti showed a tremendous resilience following the accident and managed to direct several films and plays as an infirm whereas fellini had to put an end to his career but still was able to display his talents to the neuropsychologists that treated him a speculative account is given of the links between right hemispheric symptomatology and the premorbid personality of these highly prolific patients author,Art

the aim of this work is to investigate the problem of perceptual organisation of colour through an integrated and multidisciplinary study based on art vision science and biology the colour organisation is approached starting from the amodal completion of shape and by introducing the phenomenal notions of modal and amodal completion of colour in the three multidisciplinary domains just as a shape is completed amodally behind another occluding shape so is a colour behind another occluding colour or behind a bright light reflected by a three dimensional object the modal completion of colour was studied through the watercolour illusion and a painting by kandinsky the amodal completion of colour was investigated through the lighting illusion and the renaissance chiaroscuro that created the illusion of depth the phenomenal results showed the effectiveness of the amodal completion of colours used by artists and by nature in biological colouration four general principles of the amodal completion of colour useful to understand the more general problem of phenomenal organisation of colour in art vision science and biology are suggested author,Art
the effect of handedness on cognitive functioning has been the subject of much controversy the influential pathological left handedness theory posited by coren and halpern 1991 claims that left handedness is probabilistically related to deviations from the neurological and cognitive norm many studies have failed to find negative effects of left handedness on cognitive functioning but most of these studies related handedness to cognition at one moment in time such studies do not exclude the possibility that sinistrality may be related to a more pronounced age related longitudinal decline in cognitive functions this hypothesis was tested in the present study in a longitudinal study involving a large population sample of cognitively intact people aged at least 50 years at baseline we evaluated the effect of handedness on age related decline in four major cognitive domains speed of information processing verbal learning long term verbal memory and executive functioning the results failed to provide support for the hypothesis that sinistrality is associated with a more pronounced age related cognitive decline recommendations for future studies are provided author,Art

a new form of art redefines the boundary between invention and discovery as understood in the sciences and creativity as understood in the plastic arts can pure geometry be perceived by the man in the street as beautiful to be more specific can a shape that is defined by a simple equation or a simple rule of construction be perceived by people other than geometers as having aesthetic valuenamely as being at least surprisingly decorativeor perhaps even as being a work of art when the geometric shape is a fractal the answer is yes even when fractals are taken raw they are attractive they lend themselves to painting by numbers that is surprisingly effective even in the hands of the rank amateur and the true artists sensibility finds them a novel and attractive support author,Art

halloumi cheese is a popular cheese in lebanon and the middle east today health conscious consumers are demanding lower fat foods with sensory properties that are comparable to their full fat counterparts the objectives of this work were to characterize the physicochemical and sensory properties of bovine and ovine halloumi of different fat levels and to provide a baseline sensory profile for halloumi cheese full fat reduced fat and low fat samples were produced from ovine and bovine milks in 2 batches resulting in a total of 12 batches the fat protein moisture ash ph sodium and calcium levels were determined and the instrumental textural characteristics of the samples were measured using a texture analyzer eleven trained panelists used quantitative descriptive analysis to profile the sensory attributes of the samples and an acceptability test was conducted with 84 panelists the type of milk ovine vs bovine significantly affected the moisture and protein contents whereas fat level had a significant effect on moisture fat protein and ash contents instrumental texture analysis revealed that the type of milk significantly affected adhesiveness chewiness and hardness whereas the fat level affected chewiness hardness adhesiveness and cohesiveness the sensory results of the trained panelists revealed that the ovine cheese was more yellow and harder than bovine cheese whereas bovine cheese was squeakier low fat and reduced fat cheeses were also more yellow and harder than full fat cheese and full fat cheese was more moist with no significant differences between the low fat and reduced fat varieties type of milk and fat level did not have any significant effect on fermented flavor whey flavor or saltiness bovine cheese received significantly higher scores on overall acceptability texture acceptability and significantly lower scores on the food action rating scale full fat cheese obtained the highest score on overall acceptability and texture acceptability decreased significantly with decreasing fat levels author,Art

to explain the surprisingly high frequency of congenital red green colour blindness the suggestion has been made that dichromats might be at an advantage in breaking certain kinds of colour camouflage we have compared the performance of dichromats and normal observers in a task in which texture is camouflaged by colour the texture elements in a target area differed in either orientation or size from the background elements in one condition the texture elements were all of the same colour in the camouflage condition they were randomly coloured red or green for trichromats it proved to be more difficult to detect the target region in the camouflage condition even though colour was completely irrelevant to the task dichromats n 7 did not show this effect and indeed performed better than trichromats in the camouflage condition we conclude that colour can interfere with segregation based upon texture and that dichromats are less susceptible to such interference author,Art

three experiments provide evidence that the conceptualization of moving objects and events is influenced by one s native language consistent with linguistic relativity theory monolingual english speakers and bilingual spanish english speakers tested in an english speaking context performed better than monolingual spanish speakers and bilingual spanish english speakers tested in a spanish speaking context at sorting novel animated objects and events into categories on the basis of manner of motion an attribute that is prominently marked in english but not in spanish in contrast english and spanish speakers performed similarly at classifying on the basis of path an attribute that is prominently marked in both languages similar results were obtained regardless of whether categories were labeled by novel words or numbered suggesting that an english speaking tendency to focus on manner of motion is a general phenomenon and not limited to word learning effects of age of acquisition of english were also observed on the performance of bilinguals with early bilinguals performing similarly in the 2 language contexts and later bilinguals showing greater contextual variation author,Art
degraded character recognition is a challenging problem in the field of optical character recognition ocr the performance of an optical character recognition depends upon printed quality of the input documents many ocrs have been designed which correctly identifies the fine printed documents but very few reported work has been found on the recognition of the degraded documents the efficiency of the ocrs system decreases if the input image is degraded in this paper a novel approach based on gradient pattern for recognizing degraded printed character is proposed the approach makes use of gradient pattern of an individual character for recognition experiments were conducted on character image that is either digitally written or a degraded character extracted from historical documents and the results are found to be satisfactory author,Art

nowadays aesthetics and the notion of beauty play an increasingly significant role in interactive art and design products and consequently in scientific research in these fields this paper outlines a rudimentary theory of the notion of beauty in interactive artifacts my argument takes as its starting point kant s definition of the sentiment of beauty as an act of judgment this judgment unfolds at two very different but interrelated levels the first level consists of the participant s physiological aesthetic judgment of the digital system s output this judgment determines the participant s next inter action and is the basis for performative flow at the second level beauty is seen as an emergent phenomenon that manifests itself as a reflective sentiment i e as a result of the interplay between already experienced flow and the idea of the interactive artifact s potentiality the idea of potentiality is on the one hand an intrinsic part of the artificial interaction system an interactive artifact but on the other hand is experienced as a transcendental phenomenon that appears to overcome the rigid limits of algorithmic systems the present paper concretizes my theoretical findings by analyzing two very different interactive artifacts david rokeby s very nervous system from the early days of digital interactive art and the online community second life as an example of a virtual meeting place author,Art

the musical use of low and ultra low frequencies is closely related to the twentieth century development of electronic and digital media in historical respect this development continues the steady exploration of the lower ranges of musically significant sound which started with the rise of polyphony this paper focuses on the consequences this sonic expansion has for the aesthetics of music starting from a recent composition for voice harpsichord and live electronics by composer yannis kyriakides it is argued that electronically produced and mediated sound cannot be considered apart from its self reflectivity and theatricality however it is also shown that in kyriakides and elsewhere the relation between the appearance and the appearing between content and form is blurred by on the one hand a particular use of ultra low frequencies which engage the body in musical perception and on the other hand a more general instability of the musical phenomenon qua object obviously this instability also affects the notion of musical subjectivity in the final section the blurring of the topological distinction between insides and outsides is briefly analyzed introducing the notion of sonic flesh referring to aristotle hegel and nancy this notion articulates a reflexivity which underlies both sonic and subjective principles author,Art

computer art has become a meaningless term because soon virtually all art will be computerized in some way or another the author introduces the concept of proceduralism as a label to represent a special class of art one that constructs images using abstract qualitative and quantitative parameters rather than simulates classical drawing and painting this approach to making art differs radically from drawing and painting approaches because the picture making process is detached from the picture the net result is that an entirely new area of creativity has been unveiled for the artist as such proceduralism is a logical successor to conceptual process art it is a major art movement and a new medium author,Art

we introduce unicrepaint a digital painting system that allows the user to paint with physical objects by acquiring three parameters from the interacting object the form the color pattern and the contact pressure the design of the system is motivated by a hypothesis that integrating direct input from physical objects with digital painting offers unique creative experiences to the user a major technical challenge in implementing unicrepaint is to resolve the conflict between input and output i e to be able to capture the form and color pattern of contacting objects from a camera while at the same time be able to present the captured data using a projector we present a solution for this problem we implemented a prototype and carried out a user study with fifteen novice users additionally five professional users with art related backgrounds participated in a user study to obtain insights into how professionals might view our system the results show that unicrepaint offers unique experiences with painting in a creative manner also its potentials beyond mere artwork are suggested author,Art
the basic idea of a hologram is an apparition of something that does not exist but appears as if it was just in front of our eyes these illusion techniques were invented a long time ago the philosopher and alchemist giovanni battista della porta invented an effect that was later developed and brought to fame by prof j h pepper 18211900 and applied in theatrical performances the innovation nowadays consists in the adopted technology to produce them taking advantage of the available digital technologies the challenge we are going to discuss is using holograms in the museum context inside showcases to realize a new form of scenography and dramaturgy around the exhibited objects case studies will be presented with a detailed analysis of the eu project cemec connecting early medieval european collections where holographic showcases have been designed built and experimented in eu museums in this case the coexistence in the same space of the real artifact and the virtual contents and interior setup of the showcase its dynamic lighting system the script and the sound converge to create an expressive unity the reconstruction of sensory and symbolic dimensions that are beyond any museum object can take the visitor in the middle of a lively and powerful experience with such technology and represents an advancement in the museological sector user experience results and a list of best practices will be presented in the second part of the paper out of the tests and research activities conducted in these three years of the project author,Art

creatures of the night that stalk their prey underground are rarely clad in bright colors but a surprising number of tarantulasground dwelling nocturnal predatorscarry hairs that are a vivid shade of blue last year researchers found that this hue was surprisingly common it actually had evolved multiple times in different lineages and converged on remarkably similar shades of blue across 40 of 53 tarantula groups 1 n n n nseveral types of tarantulas including this green bottle blue tarantula have evolved to display a vivid shade of blue that results not from pigments but from a phenomenon known as structural color image courtesy of shutterstock cathy keifer n n n nlike many shades of blues in the natural world tarantulas tints are not formed by colored pigments instead theyre a result of nanostructure patterns that interfere with specific wavelengths of light a phenomenon known as structural color unlike pigments which are colored because excited electrons absorb certain wavelengths of light and emit others structural colors are purely physical arrangements often created by colorless materials figuring out the precise patterns that create tarantulas brilliant hues may not only offer up insights into animal adaptations but could point to means for creating colors from new less toxic materials for example longer lasting brighter paints one of the keys to such advances could be a tool most wouldnt consider for the study of animal hair 3d printing n nthe nanostructures in tarantulas take myriad shapes some are smooth cylinders author,Art

back in the 19th century during the blooming age of impressionism a new branch of art has been introduced known as pointillism this particular technique uses tiny dots as the brush strokes in order to create paintings both discrete up close as dots and continuous from distance as patterns are inherited in this form of art we have taken inspiration from both the sector of art and the calculative form of digital image processing by combining both of them we have presented a formula in order to create pointillism art the most challenging part we have faced in the distribution of dots in other words pixels in the canvas and maintaining the subjective concept by regulation of the edges at first color palette has been generated by finding out the most popular colors in the input image then some modification has been done for preserving better by rgb space to color space analysis then pixels are being converted as the pixel cluster according to stroke library finally this clusters have been distributed in the canvas image for producing pointillistic image we have also compared various form of distribution of pixel clusters and their effects as well as we have determined the necessary steps in order to give it the artistic effects most of all art is a subjective sector we have proposed one possible formula in a quest of creating towards the best author,Art

sandro botticelli was one of the most esteemed painters and draughtsmen among renaissance artists under the patronage of the de medici family he was active in florence during the flourishing of the renaissance trend towards the reclamation of lost medical and anatomical knowledge of ancient times through the dissection of corpses combining the typical attributes of the elegant courtly style with hallmarks derived from the investigation and analysis of classical templates he left us immortal masterpieces the excellence of which incomprehensibly waned and was rediscovered only in the 1890s few know that it has already been reported that botticelli concealed the image of a pair of lungs in his masterpiece the primavera the present investigation provides evidence that botticelli embedded anatomic imagery of the lung in another of his major paintings namely the birth of venus both canvases were most probably influenced and enlightened by the neoplatonic philosophy of the humanist teachings in the de medici s circle and they represent an allegorical celebration of the cycle of life originally generated by the divine wind or breath this paper supports the theory that because of the anatomical knowledge to which he was exposed botticelli aimed to enhance the iconographical meaning of both the masterpieces by concealing images of the lung anatomy within them author,Art
virtual shadows provide important cues to determine the positional relationship between virtual objects and a real scene however it s difficult to render shadows in the real scene on optical see through head mounted displays without occlusion capability in the previous work we cast virtual shadows not with physical light attenuation but with brightness induction caused by virtual objects referred to as shadow inducers which surround the shadow area to gradually amplify the intensity of the real scene pattern 4 however because the shadow inducer was prepared beforehand the shape of the shadow is constant the real scene shadowing is limited to a flat surface and a large of viewpoint change is impossible in this demonstration we propose a method to generate shadow inducers in real time that can change the shape of virtual objects and the viewpoint of users in this method depending on the appearance of shadows the surrounding luminance is gradually amplified with the difference of gaussian dog representing characteristics of human vision users can observe shadows of moving and deforming virtual objects on a real tabletop and other non planar objects author,Art

the aim was to use non destructive spectroscopic techniques in selected paintings of the ionian school of the museum of zakynthos under the supervision of the ephorate of antiquities of zakynthos we used raman and xrf spectroscopy in order to identify the pigments of the paintings n our investigation the use of these techniques for the first time at the museum of post byzantine art of zakynthos is more than essential due to the historical particularities of the island a massive earthquake followed by a wildfire within the city bounds devastated the island of zakynthos in august 1953 and its archival wealth was almost altogether ruined these resulted in bibliography gaps and lack of archival material the scarce scientific information for the understanding of the materials used by the post byzantine artists during the 18th19th century with the only exception being the artists manuals and the absence of identified paintings led to the use of analytical techniques in order to answer questions that the history of art could not answer the study was focused on four paintings of the temple of saint george of petroutsos in zakynthos which has been moved after the destruction of the church due to the earthquake of 1953 to the church of ascension in the centre of zakynthos as well the paintings that were examined were separated from the temple and today are exhibited in the museum of zakynthos author,Art

one of the most interesting if frustrating aspects of charting the history of computer art is trying to understand the intersections of specific technologies and artistic experimentation it is rarely as clear cut as a simple linear influence of one to the other partly because artists are able to envision all kinds of possibilities that technology might enable them to realize in some kind of form but as they do so the technology is itself shaped especially in terms of how it is perceived by others do artists find a way to give technologies an aesthetic outlet or do some technologies possess or facilitate a characteristic aesthetic that finds its expression through specific artists certainly in the history of computer art it would seem that particular aesthetics technologies and artists are closely intertwined in certain periods this intertwining of art technology and ideas stolen from the natural world has never been so arguably merged as the period in the history of computer art from 1980 to 1993 we take as the defining start of this period the initial work of mandelbrot on fractals that became known as the mandelbrot set and led to his famous illustrated art science book the fractal geometry of nature in 1993 this first highly creative period in evolutionary computer art came to an end with major publications by pioneers karl sims stephen todd and william latham author,Art

resumen una de las principales dificultades para una correcta captura de imagenes subacuaticas utilizando medios electronicos camara fotografica o de video se presenta en el mismo ambiente subacuatico en donde la iluminacion y el tono de la fuente de luz cambian dependiendo de la profundidad del escenario para la captura de la imagen esto debido a las diferentes longitudes de onda que se logran filtrar a diferentes niveles de profundidad lo que trae como consecuencia la captura de diferentes tonos con condiciones de iluminacion no uniformes debido a la dispersion de la luz incidente y a las diferentes longitudes de onda capturadas por el sensor del dispositivo de adquisicion lo que provoca que los colores sean modificados como solucion se propone el uso del modelo retinex este modelo se basa en el entendimiento del sistema visual humano svh hvs y hace uso del fenomeno de constancia del color esto para disminuir el efecto producido mediante los problemas identificados anteriormente este modelo se utilizara como una etapa de pre procesamiento para que de esta manera se manipule la escena capturada los resultados se veran mediante la modificacion del contenido cromatico de la imagen principalmente en las areas con poca iluminacion finalmente en este articulo se evaluaran los resultados experimentales de dos modelos aplicados a imagenes subacuaticas retinex simple y retinex multiescala author,Art

most art museums provide audio guides or more recently multi media guides with static context such as background information to enrich their exhibits with an extra layer of content usually there is no actual interaction with the museums exhibit possible no hands on experience that fosters a deeper cognitive engagement the integration of multi touch tables has a great potential for collaborative experiences we designed a touch table application that allows for collaborative and active drawing experiences and conducted two usability studies one in a laboratory setting and one in the field the design study was structured in three phases domain and problem analysis user experience and interface design and evaluation the results show that the collaborative aspect drawing on one picture simultaneously in different personal areas was accepted and praised by the visitors the study indicates that museums with mostly passive viewable artefacts can profit from interacitve and collaborative content which enhances the general experience in their exhibitions author,Art
searching for a missing person is not an easy task to accomplish so over the years search methods have been developed the problem is that the methods currently available have certain limitations and these limitations are reflected in time location time location in a person search is a very important factor that rescuers cannot afford to waste because the missing person is exposed to great dangers using computer vision is expected to search for any missing person designing and implementing algorithms in order to an unmanned aerial vehicle perform this task also thanks to the speed of this is expected to reduce the time location author,Art

even though using typed text to memorize thoughts and ideas has become increasingly convenient people still often use handwritten notes in daily life because it takes less time to write a note using a hand than to use a digital device that may not be immediately accessible however the size and position of drawings in handwritten notes tend to involve irregular and irrelevant organization in particular under limited time constraints a poorly organized note decreases the understanding and memorizing of its contents because of low readability to improve its readability we propose digital notebook editing methods for rearranging data by using the characteristics of digital pen data in this paper we describe several fundamental functions to support the rearrangement of digital notebook and categorize them by its automatism property through our experiment we find that the proposed functions did not significantly improve short term memorization however they did facilitate the creation of a well organized note within a limited time author,Art
sonia delaunay 18851979 was a key figure in the parisian avant garde whose vivid and colourful work spanned painting fashion and design in 2015 tate modern in london presented the first uk retrospective to assess the breadth of her vibrant artistic career from her early figurative painting in the 1900s to the energetic abstract work of the 1960s the exhibition offered a radical reassessment of delaunays importance as an artist showcasing her originality and creativity across the twentieth century born in odessa and trained in germany sonia delaunay came to paris in 1906 to join the emerging avant garde she met and married the artist robert delaunay with whom she developed simultaneism a style of abstract compositions with dynamic contrasting colours and shapes many iconic examples of these works were brought together at tate modern including bal bullier 1913 and electric prisms 1914 her work expressed the energy of modern urban life celebrating for example the birth of electric street lighting and the excitement of contemporary ballets and ballrooms the exhibition showed how the artist dedicated her life to experimenting with colour and abstraction bringing her ideas off the canvas and into the world through tapestry textiles mosaic and fashion delaunay premiered her first simultaneous dress of bright patchwork colours in 1913 and even opened a boutique in madrid in 1918 her atelier simultan in paris went on to produce radical and progressive designs for scarves umbrellas hats shoes and swimming costumes throughout the 1920s and 1930s clients included the hollywood star gloria swanson and the architect erno goldfinger as well as department stores like metz co and liberty the exhibition revealed how delaunays designs presented her as a progressive woman synonymous with modernity embroidering poetry onto fabric turning her apartment into a three dimensional collage and creating daring costumes for diaghilevs ballets russes the diverse inspirations behind delaunays work were also explored from the highly personal approach to colour which harked back to her childhood in russia to the impact of her years in spain and portugal where she painted the orange seller 1915 and flamenco singers 191516 the show also revealed the inspiration provided by modern technology throughout delaunays career from the trans siberian railway to the airplane and from the eiffel tower to the electric light bulb it also included her vast seven metre murals motor dashboard and propeller created for the 1937 international exposition in paris and never before shown in the uk following her husbands death in 1941 sonia delaunays work took on a more formal freedom including rhythmic compositions in angular forms and harlequin colours which in turn inspired geometric tapestries carpets and mosaics delaunay continued to experiment with abstraction in the post war era just as she had done since its birth in the 1910s becoming a champion for a new generation of artists and an inspiring figure for creative practitioners to this day to illustrate the point david seidner wrote when interviewing her in los angeles in 1981 author,Art

the history of color is full of instances of how and why certain colors become to be associated with certain concepts ideas politics status and power sometimes the connotations occur arbitrarily like in the instance when pink was assigned to baby girls and blue started to be associated with baby boys at the turn of 19 century paoletti 1987 sometimes though color associations have very tangible reasons such as in the case of marian blue and why over the centuries it was reserved only for painting virgin mary the reason is to be found in the scarcity of the rock lapis lazuli even more valuable than gold from which the blue pigments were extracted individual colors have convoluted and contested histories since they have been attached to many symbols at any given time john gage an art historian who has devoted 30 years of research on the topic of color explains the conundrum of what he terms as politics of color in a simple fashion the same colors or combinations of colors can for example be shown to have held quite antithetical connotations in different periods and cultures and even at the same time and in the same place gage 1990 the purpose of the present study is to introduce a method for automatically extracting color distributions and main colors of paintings as well as color schemes of people in paintings by visualizing these over time for crossreferencing with historical data will reveal changes of how particular colors were used in a given time period and culture in this study we will look at artworks to find out whether certain colors or tones are associated with a specific gender and if these connotations change over time to that end we apply algorithmic tools to process very large datasets automatically and information visualization tools to depict the findings author,Art

interest in the colour reproduction of artworks and artefacts is gaining more significance as it is now recognised that some artefacts are too delicate to be exhibited and some important landmarks are no longer around due to damage by war or climate change this brings a need for further research in how to obtain and transmit accurate colour information for the reproduction of texture three d artefacts and the reconstruction of lost colour and heritage colours there is a need to regain an understanding of the cultural implications of colour and an emerging area of discussion in relation to resilience n n cadmium red refers to a chemical colour that has been used and loved by artists for centuries yet this extremely toxic colour is under threat cadmium is used in batteries for electroplating jewellery footwear and of course paint the restrictions on cadmium like chromium or mercury are obviously necessary for us and the environment but have posed a problem for many industries reliant on these materials a key challenge has been the costs involved in remanufacture using alternative materials in the context of new legislation relating to heavy metals such as cadmium ink manufacturers for example are now forced to reconsider the content of their inks and replace toxic pigments and materials with more environmentally safer versions n n yet despite the change in the constituents of the paint the naming traditions that are so closely associated with art history are still used by paint manufacturers the romance of cadmium red remains even though distant from its traditional and cultural origins many the pigment colours of the 15th and 16th centuries are far removed from the dyes and acrylics of the 21st century but the naming of these new equivalents uses the terminology originally generated from the materials or associations of their forebears the question remains what impact does this have for the colour restorer or colour conservator how might conventions and standards in colour naming for the paint manufacturer or the domestic paint industry be developed n n we ask how red is the cadmium red that is now available based on an inspection of traditional and contemporary paint charts many variations of hues associated with cadmium red can be seen the range in saturation and hue will be explored we also look closely at how a red hue that is loosely associated to a heritage name is used in the 21st century n n albeit seeming a somewhat narrow question it is predicated on a much larger enquiry that looks at the implications arising from a situation in which colour manifest in material form is an increasingly rare commodity this has occurred due to the rise if digital fabrication technologies redistributed manufacturing applications for mimicking paint colours and brush strokes and 2 5d printing the challenge of the sustainability of using some colour sources and their resilience has also constrained colour use in an apocryphal story by jasper fford about a world where colour is indeed synthetic shades of grey the road to high saffron green is piped to the grass to colour it green and colour is collected as a rare commodity the question here is what is the future of colour as computational versions or facsimiles of chemical colours or colour that is salvaged n n in a world of seemingly plenty our resources are dwindling yet colour remains a vital resource for our economy society and culture our diversity of geography means that environmental colour the colour of the stuff with which we build our dwellings and those with which we describe our built and natural environments have imbued our culture with a wide sensibility in respect of how colour works in everyday contemporary life but we need to understand how we manage its integrity and our language for describing this resource in the light of new technology and care for the lived environment author,Art
experiments with electro encephalographic recordings eeg capture oscillations of the potential of neural membranes these signals represent a high percentage of brain activity in both thought and body movement therefore in this study we explore the use of eeg for classification of eye movement triggered by the observation of a visual stimuli such that the recognized movements can be used to control a drone to achieve this a database is generated and divided into two groups training and testing generated with five test subjects with an average age of 28 years the signal was processed by taking the statistical values that represent the most significant changes and generating the characteristic vectors of each of the samples once the neural network was trained with these parameters it proceeds to classify new instances and depending on the classification an instruction or location point is sent to a drone 201 research in computing science 114 2016 pp 201212 rec 2016 03 08 acc 2016 05 09 controlled by an proportional integral derivative controller pid which estimates the position of the drone through a motion capture vicon system author,Art

the show started at twilight on a balmy evening last february outside tasmanias museum of old and new art i sat spellbound leaning back on a granite bench gazing up at a large white fiberglass canopy that floated several meters above my head light projected onto it began to gradually morph from one gorgeous hue to another lilac deepened to purple then shifted to burnt orange to chartreuse green and on it went meanwhile through a rectangular aperture cut in the middle of the canopy the darkening sky seemed mysteriously to lose depth becoming a flat plane of color that looked as if it had been painted on the ceiling the interplay between artificial and natural light was hallucinatory as the hue of the former changed so apparently did that of the latter in a silence punctured only by the raucous laughing of a pair of kookaburras the program shimmered on ending after perhaps an hour when the sky had become pitch black a truly magical experience one that i shall remember as long as i live figs 1 3 author,Art

real world lighting often consists of multiple illuminants with different colors separating and manipulating these illuminants in post process is a challenging problem that requires either significant manual input or calibrated scene geometry and lighting in this work we leverage a flash noflash image pair to analyze and edit scene illuminants based on their color differences we derive a novel physics based relationship between color variations in the observed flash no flash intensities and the chromaticies and surface shading corresponding to individual scene illuminants our technique uses this constraint to automatically separate an image into constituent images lit by each illuminant each light component can then be edited independently to enable applications like white balance lighting editing and intrinsic image decompositions we demonstrate that this technique outperforms state of the art techniques for some applications and enables other applications that are not possible with previous work author,Art

we can t say what color is but we know what happens if after a shock to the nape we cease to see the colors some neuro scientists like oliver sacks have explained such matter by observing a painter suddenly turned blind to colors who went on living with the memory of colors that he was no longer able to see and the people from a small atoll in micronesia decimated by a tsunami wave who after some time had selected its population in one half capable of seeing colors and committed to agriculture and a half blind to colors committed to nightly fishing n to seek an answer we can say that color is not a phenomenon of light but rather a perception and elaboration of our brain but let s consider the first case n following a car crash an american painter bangs his head against the windscreen of his car no visible damages only a small disappointment apologies from the driver of the other car these things happen apparently n but that very evening and still more the morning after that painter r became aware that he was no longer seeing colors the world around him was suddenly empty of any chromatic stimulus a world suddenly and completely gray this is the first word a world awfully dirty this is the second sensation for something almost inconceivable for a painter nearly deadly even gray is a color but such sudden monochrome shutoff is a dead color the image of a world that can t be lived in n the painter r is suddenly become blind to colors he can t see other than the ghosts of a light surrounded by blurred shadows now nearer now farther starting from a black now present and a moment later absent a going till a concentration of stunning light beams almost glaring n an experience such as this one can t be really shared or described besides the sensation of an absurd and unmotivated torture almost an experience of death with respect to a mystery that human beings have in common with butterflies the ability to see colors n we can only try to understand how it feels the painter r moves along a sort of fog that comes and goes independently from his movements in the space of a room or outside hesitating from time to time for fear of stumbling or trampling on something rotten n the outer aspect of things and people even those who are more familiar is completely changed and became dumb and hostile the outline of the things and of the faces was vague and indefinite and this uncertainty turned any visual interest into something unpleasant and disappointing anything and any action becomes wrong and artificial but most of all it becomes sort of stained impure the painter for example couldn t stand the change in the features of other people and even the aspect of his own face in the mirror that appeared like an empty window with a person of smoke inside n the complexion of the people around him including his own and that of his wife was horribly gray and unrecognizable the color of the skin in all its possible shades appeared like dirty paper worn out linen lacerated by terrible dirt the color tv set was an unbearable atrocity not even comparable to the reassuring black and white of old movies n food was a horrible litter after a long abstinence from food that almost lead him to consumption the painter r surrendered to eat blindfolded relying on the memory of smell and flavor because the pleasure of seeing a tasty dish was lost forever all this only because of the lack of the colors n the painter luckily maintained a sort of memory of colors that despite a sense of absence and detachment from the world allowed him to imagine always blindfolded a pleasant sensation of reunion to the colorful forms of his former chromatic life poor comfort which however he didn t want and couldn t give up and by contrast even conceiving to commit suicide when facing the despair of continuing to live in such a condition n in his brain and not in his eyes something very serious had happened he following an injury had lost the knowledge and sensation of color while retaining the awareness almost obsessive of the lost color which just like any loss became more and more the absolute meaning of vision not only a quality but the truth of vision itself n the painter r was victim of a rare yet possible event just like an invisible bullet had hit and damaged forever the internals of his two beans causing a paralysis the ability of seeing colors results indeed essential for human activities much more than monochrome vision that is typical of most of mammals n the reason why human beings are capable of seeing color remains a mystery and we can only imagine what would happen when such ability is lost our painter was prey to despair birds and snakes are capable of a four color sight human beings had once the same capability until in the struggle for survival the vision of two of the colors was lost and later on a third one was regained this is how today human beings are capable of a three colors perception just like the monitor of common computers r red g green b blue that the most advanced technology completes with y yellow n however the attention and the disposition of humans for colors seems to be perfectly aligned with human evolution and intelligence it may sound impossible but 77 000 years ago in blombos cave south africa primitive people were able to manufacture and collect a huge amount of colored sticks decorated with geometric motifs presumably used for body painting the aesthetic attitude towards the world becomes their ability to survive in the race to evolution letting at the same time their brain cortex grow through colors author,Art

we show that a large and realistic face dataset can be built from news photographs and their associated captions our dataset consists of 44 773 face images obtained by applying a face nder to approximately half a million captioned news images this dataset is more realistic than usual face recognition datasets because it contains faces captured iin the wildi in a variety of congurations with respect to the camera taking a variety of expressions and under illumination of widely varying color faces are extracted from the images and names from the associated caption our system uses a clustering procedure to nd the correspondence between faces and associated names in news picture caption pairs the context in which a name appears in a caption provides powerful cues as to whether it is depicted in the associated image by incorporating simple natural language techniques we are able to improve our name assignment signicantly once the procedure is complete we have an accurately labeled set of faces an appearance model for each individual depicted and a natural language model that can produce accurate results on captions in isolation author,Art

in recent decades rapid progress in technology and changes in media environment have made it possible to convey works of art to the masses even if it is hard to preserve the meaning of an original work of arts conception such problems have occurred particularly with respect to several asian nations whose works of art have a long history since they cause concern among lovers of such artworks as to whether or not they are willing to give up the meaning of their entire culture japan is among the forefront of such nations and is going through a period of trouble on whether it should give up its unique styles of art as a result of changes in life style consequently japan is taking pains to determine how to preserve its cultural traditions while at the same time taking steps in the right direction to take its place as one of the member nations of modern society in our research work we have attempted to graft traditional art and culture onto the new concept of media technology to enlarge the field of media art and to expresses works of art in the form of products that can be used in day to day life not simply as simple pieces of work in which mass media has no interest we also attempted to find ways to adopt art works to media and to this day and age escaping out of date techniques or artisans skills that remain useable today we not only show the techniques involved in creating works of art but also analyze how the media s re analysis of traditional art and culture affects the public and makes it reassess the meanings of works of art author,Art

people love to exchange stories stories provide a context for the events feelings ideas and relationships that make up the fabric of our daily lives when we describe an important experience in our life to another person we often shape it in the form of a story stories are a means of communication we are on the threshold of a revolutionary change in how people will communicate with each other and the environment a global wireless communications network coupled with computational devices that know where they are and are in contact with the network will knit together individuals and groups in ways we have never seen before these devices will employ speech recognition and synthesis algorithms for vision understanding and graphic synthesis and algorithms to extract meaning from text images and sounds when these devices mature they will be small portable wireless and ubiquitous they will have a deep impact on our cultures and our stories these technologies will not eliminate other more traditional media just as television did not eliminate film and film did not eliminate novels but they will open the door to new kinds of stories that can be told in new ways because these new approaches will rely heavily on underlying technologies it is exciting to try to anticipate new ways of storytelling in the hope that we can influence the development and engineering of those technologies to keep the doors of possibility and exploration wide open author,Art

interdisciplinary technologies allowing a comprehensive characterization of cancer cells are becoming increasingly important in the routine diagnostics and research of hematological neoplasms and in malignancies in general one of those methods is the fiction technique fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms this technique allows the simultaneous study of the basic morphology as well as immunophenotypic and genetic markers of tumor cells however the low number of fluorescent substances utilized in a single assay restricts the number of markers that can be studied by fiction recently a multicolor variant has been developed and termed m fiction which in addition to cellular morphology and immunophenotype allows the investigation of multiple chromosomal aberrations in only one assay in the present review we present a detailed overview on the conventional and multicolor fiction techniques and we discuss their multiple applications in the field of hematological neoplasms author,Art

for an optimum quality control in newspaper printing patches printed with different combinations of cmyk should be colorimetrically measured however control strips with a large number of color patches cannot be included into the layout of newspapers due to the additional space they need moreover such control strips require a considerable amount of time for the measurement to overcome these problems it is preferable to print and to analyze only a few color patches and to obtain most information out of these a method using neural networks has been developed to predict color values of two and three color overprints from those of the primary inks as well as color values of the primary inks from the two and three color overprints the feature of the method is that spectra are predicted from which colorimetric values xyz and l a b and densitometric values are derived the accuracy of the predicted cielab values of the primaries from those of the overprints is typically within e ab i for the two color overprints and within e ab 2 for the three color overprints author,Art

out of the picture martha rosier the bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems by steve edwards cambridge mit press 2012 pp 122 32 color illustrations 35 00 cloth 16 00 paper even though the term postmodern remains a contested category of periodization aspects of its theoretical parameters appear fixed in myriad texts while scholars may grapple with the terms of an era that remains indeterminate in certain purviews ironically it seems an established enumeration of artists exists that exemplify the mood and aesthetic of the postmodern indeed whether neophyte or experienced scholar if one surveys texts pertaining to postmodernism one can readily establish a short list of artists considered canonical to the period so while the demarcation between modern and postmodern may remain elusive to some most accounts of feminism and postmodern art for example cite the resonance of cindy sherman s photo stills and self portraits mary kelly s post pa rtu m docu ment 1973 79 and barbara kruger s photo collage your gaze hits the side of my face 1981 though invariably texts will also include citations of additional artists 1 likewise studies relating to photography and postmodernism typically contain a decisive list of artists within their pages hans haacke s shapolsfy et al manhattan real estate holdings 1971 victor burgin s between 1986 and sherrie levine s photographs of the work of male masters are often referenced in survey texts to explicate the qualities of postmodern photography 2as a photographer filmmaker and author whose work is typified as postmodern martha rosier is usually mentioned in these volumes her installation the bowery in two inadequate systems 1974 75 which is comprised of a series of forty five gelatin silver prints of text and images on twenty four backing boards is usually considered rosler s piece de resistance indicative of the postmodern aesthetic the bowery is described in many critiques as subjectless stark or cool and the subjects if there were any would be the bowery bums who are indexed only by their empty bottles and smashed cigarette packages the detritus working in tandem or against the images of the text rosler s bowery is often cited in monographs on postmodernism for shattering notions of representation and or for rosler s consideration of the tension between text and image as such the bowery is frequently named as a significant work of the 1970s according to steve edwards yet it has received no sustained gaze 6 at issue then for edwards whom readers might recognize from his work as an editor at both the oxford art journal and historical materialism or his books the maying of english photography allegories 2006f and photography a very short introduction 2006 4 is that analyses of rosler s work are inadequate themselves not only are they typically limited in their explanation of the project s theoretical resonance but the bowery s inclusion in said surveys usually functions as a marker of the shift from one paradigm to another warranting a couple of sentences a paragraph at most just enough to make the point before moving on to the next object and the next topic 6 it is not difficult to locate evidence to back this particular claim in linda hutcheon s the politics of postmodernism 1989 for example rosier and the bowery receive many quick one line mentions as well as one longer analysis that is approximately three paragraphs likewise rosler s body of work warrants two separate one line mentions in jacques ranciere s the future of the image 2007 5 but these relate to her photomontages and not the bowery neither rosier nor the bowery are cited once in the 350 page authoritative guide of postmodernism titled the routledge companion to postmodernism 2001 nor is rosler s body of work mentioned in postmodernism 2001 by eleanor heartnev part of the import then of edwards s analysis of the bowery is that his book performs a sustained read of the installation one that is complemented by biographical information about rosier such as her association with the san diego group her knowledge of language poetry her familiarity with the work of theorists such as herbert marcuse and bertolt brecht and the relationship of her work to jean luc godard and other avantgarde filmmakers author,Art

in the window of a private art galley in tel aviv i notice a large square painting which arrests attention by its very ugliness considering its color design and composition the artist is no amateur some people who are looking at it turn away in disgust others find it interesting and are ready to discuss it dispassionately what is my reaction before describing the actual painting i put myself in the skin of a young painter who loathes our society who utterly disagrees with the inhuman establishment and furiously condemns it how could he pictorially communicate this thoughts and feelings by what symbol could he show us how a powerful action would sweep away all the dirt produced in this society from which he feels so alienated an artist such as this might paint a man sitting on the toilet and by pulling the chain quickly flushing away all that is noxious it would not be a delicate motif perhaps more suitable for a pencilled caricature and with whatever artistry he painted this picture probably nobody among those in favour of the status quo of our world would buy it could a painter with such a work possibly communicate to his contemporaries something as important as for instance zola did with his article j accuse in the dreifus affair a painting such as we have described would shock the bourgeois but hardly influence a single person to achieve greater social awareness and could a rebel afford to pay is0 pounds for it to judge by certain written and pictorial decorations in many young people s rooms the painter would perhaps like to hang it in his author,Art

acknowledging that listening is a phenomenal process the subjectivity of listening should be considered an important and crucial factor that can be discussed and explained by phenomenological approaches this paper examines two listening processes perceiving and imagining as the main correlates of the listening process in which listeners engage with ea music it also discusses phenomena of soundimages the product of the two listening processes and explains what we as listeners imagine and how we imagine when we listen to electroacoustic music this argument lays the groundwork for a quaternary framework for electroacoustic listening in which listeners employ a comprehensive electroacoustic listening mechanism called acousmatic reasoning 1 imagining a listener analyses of music presuppose a listener the way that one approaches and talks about music is closely dependent on who is doing the listening understandably however identifying the listener in analysis is not a simple task as discussed by sloboda 7 and cross 3 and electroacoustic music confounds this task even further as listeners are engaged in more than musical listening gaver 4 separated musical listening from everyday listening in which the identity of an object comes to us almost instantly through the objects various features the initial stimulus of which leads us to seldom question an objects affordance separating musical from everyday listening however raises a thorny question in electroacoustic music for not only does it help listeners employ musical listening electroacoustic music may also succeed in inviting them back to the everyday world through the capturing and suggestive presentation of everyday sounds nevertheless the absence of visual and tactile information through which listeners often confirm their perceptions makes the experience incomplete the information needed to make the affordance of everyday things and experiences is as a whole inadequate and the experience difficult to accept how do listeners cope with the absence of other sense information when listening to electroacoustic music gibson argues that when faced with inadequate information our perceptual system hunts 5 and the unsuccessful hunt for additional information leads to a suspension of judgment and furthermore to a decision to cease hunting for additional cues as assumptions inferences or guessing comes into play although what gibson proposes may be in accord with the way we cope with the real world surrounding us it seems that what the listener does while listening to music is more than an assumption an inference or a guess the electroacoustic listener is engaged with the music not out of a search for truth or survival but for the pleasure of the process consequently i argue that this difference makes of listening a different situation one more intentionally creative in which the listener imagines 2 imaginal listening a thorough and passionate account of imagining is given by edward casey in his book imagining casey argues that imagination is an unpopular if not controversial subject that has either been unfairly criticized and summarily dismissed as to its role in more rational or quantitative disciplines or celebrated by disciplines like psychology and philosophy for the mysteries it might reveal 1 but this is not what casey and i mean by imagination imagining as the process of imagination is distinguished from hallucinations or illusions by the way it immediately connects our experience to phenomena and in turn works to direct our mental activities back to what is happening to us and around us at any moment quite telling is his argument that imagining does not provide us with anything we do not know because imaginative experience is inherently circular we imagine not something new but a new way to think about that which we already know 1 this is as i believe casey contends the power of imagininga power not present in other mental acts often misunderstood as imagining the encounter with aural perception that luciers i am sitting in a room for example is an experience resulted from two human processes different in kind one concerned with perceiving and another with imagining even though we perceive the sound of luciers voice gradually disintegrated into the reverberant sound of the room it is our imagining that leads us back to the works proceedings of the international computer music conference icmc 2009 montreal canada august 16 21 2009 author,Art

accessing personal and online music libraries with thousands of songs has become an everyday activity instead of textual lists the libraries can also be accessed using graphical visualizations such as adaptive avatars to develop the idea further we designed 17 stereotypical avatars representing different musical genres to study how well the avatars were recognized an online questionnaire with 71 participants was arranged this paper discusses the design of the avatars in more detail explains which musical genres were selected for the study and why and presents the results of the questionnaire author,Art

of human islet architecture has not yet been reported the aim of this work was to describe our observations on the arrangement of human islet cells n n nresearch design and methods nhuman pancreas specimens and isolated islets were processed for histology sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after immunostaining for islet hormones and endothelial cells n n nresults nin small human islets 40 60 mum in diameter beta cells had a core position alpha cells had a mantle position and vessels laid at their periphery in bigger islets alpha cells had a similar mantle position but were found also along vessels that penetrate and branch inside the islets as a consequence of this organization the ratio of beta cells to alpha cells was constantly higher in the core than in the mantle part of the islets and decreased with increasing islet diameter this core mantle segregation of islet cells was also observed in type 2 diabetic donors but not in cultured isolated islets three dimensional analysis revealed that islet cells were in fact organized into trilaminar epithelial plates folded with different degrees of complexity and bordered by vessels on both sides in epithelial plates most beta cells were located in a central position but frequently showed cytoplasmic extensions between outlying non beta cells n n nconclusions nhuman islets have a unique architecture allowing all endocrine cells to be adjacent to blood vessels and favoring heterologous contacts between beta and alpha cells while permitting homologous contacts between beta cells author,Art
we conducted an exploratory investigation in an area where nut cracking by wild capuchin monkeys is common knowledge among local residents in addition to observing male and female capuchin monkeys using stones to pound open nuts on stone anvils we surveyed the surrounding area and found physical evidence that monkeys cracked nuts on rock outcrops boulders and logs collectively termed anvils anvils which were identified by numerous shallow depressions on the upper surface the presence of palm shells and debris and the presence of loose stones of an appropriate size to pound nuts were present even on the tops of mesas the stones used to crack nuts can weigh gt 1 kg and are remarkably heavy for monkeys that weigh lt 4 kg the abundance of shell remains and depressions in the anvil surface at numerous anvil sites indicate that nut cracking activity is common and long enduring many of the stones found on anvils presumably used to pound nuts are river pebbles that are not present in the local area we surveyed except on or near the anvils therefore we surmise that they were transported to the anvil sites ecologically and behaviorally nut cracking by capuchins appears to have strong parallels to nut cracking by wild chimpanzees the presence of abundant anvil sites limited alternative food resources abundance of palms and the habit of the palms in this region to produce fruit at ground level all likely contribute to the monkeys routine exploitation of palm nuts via cracking them with stones this discovery provides a new reference point for discussions regarding the evolution of tool use and material culture in primates routine tool use to exploit keystone food resources is not restricted to living great apes and ancestral hominids author,Art
fludarabine cyclophosphamide and rituximab fcr has represented a significant treatment advancement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll in the new scenario of targeted agents there is an increasing interest in identifying patients who gain the maximum benefit from fcr in this observational multicenter retrospective analysis of 404 cll patients receiving frontline fcr the combination of three biomarkers that are widely tested before treatment ighv mutation status 11q deletion and 17p deletion available in 80 of the study cohort allowed to identify a very low risk category of patients carrying mutated ighv genes but neither 11q or 17p deletion that accounted for 28 of all cases the majority of very low risk patients 71 remained free of progression after treatment and their hazard of relapse decreased after 4 years from fcr the life expectancy of very low risk patients 91 at 5 years was superimposable to that observed in the matched normal general population indicating that neither the disease nor complications of its treatment affected survival in this favorable cll group these findings need a prospective validation and may be helpful for the design of clinical trials aimed at comparing fcr to new targeted treatments of cll and possibly for optimized disease management author,Art
this study explores the effect of color of book cover and typeface of title and author name on human gaze behavior while browsing bookshelves an eye tracking experiment was performed with 23 participants using a wearable eye tracker and 96 books the difference of gaze duration time and the number of book subjects chosen was analyzed in two categories between warm color book covers and cold color ones and between ming style typeface and gothic typeface results showed no effect of book cover color on gaze duration and user choice however typeface of book title and author name had an effect it was revealed that gothic typeface was more attractive if book titles had meaning author,Art

though auditory pitch is customarily mapped in western cultures onto spatial verticality high low both anthropological reports and cognitive studies suggest that pitch may be mapped onto a wide variety of other domains we collected a total number of 35 pitch mappings and investigated in four experiments how these mappings are used and structured in particular we inquired 1 how western subjects apply western and non western metaphors to high and low pitches 2 whether mappings applied in an abstract conceptual task are similarly applied by listeners to actual music 3 how mappings of spatial height relate to these pitch mappings and 4 how mappings of high and low pitch associate with other dimensions in particular quantity size intensity and valence the results show strong agreement among western participants in applying familiar and unfamiliar metaphors for pitch in both an abstract conceptual task exp 1 and in a music listening task exp 2 indicating that diverse cross domain mappings for pitch exist latently besides the common verticality metaphor furthermore limited overlap between mappings of spatial height and pitch height was found suggesting that the ubiquity of the verticality metaphor in western usage notwithstanding cross domain pitch mappings are largely independent of that metaphor and seem to be based upon other underlying dimensions part of the discrepancy between spatial height and pitch height is that for pitch up is not necessarily more nor is it necessarily good high pitch is only more for height intensity and brightness it is less for mass size and quantity we discuss implications of these findings for music and speech prosody and their relevance to notions of embodied cognition and of cross domain magnitude representation author,Art
the material for this work was obtained from seven eyes removed because of malignant growths foveal and parafoveal samples of the retinas were taken and transverse measurements were made of the absorbance spectra of the outer segments of the rods and cones using a liebman microspectrophotometer four kinds of spectra were obtained with absorbance peaks at the following wavelengths rods 496 3 2 3 nm n 39 red cones 558 4 5 2 nm n 58 green cones 530 8 3 5 nm n 45 blue cones 419 0 3 6 nm n 5 the distribution of the peaks was unimodal for the rods for the red and green cones however there was evidence for bimodal distributions with sub population maxima at 563 2 3 1 nm n 27 and 554 2 2 3 nm n 31 for the reds and at 533 7 2 1 nm n 23 and 527 8 1 8 nm n 22 for the greens a substantial difference in mean spectral location of the red cones was observed between patient 1 561 nm and patient 4 553 nm both patients were classified as normal trichromats by all clinical tests of colour vision but there was a clear difference in their relative sensitivities to long wave fields in both direction and magnitude this difference proved to be that required by the microspectrophotometric results author,Art
