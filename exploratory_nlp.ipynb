       "'objective  lifethreatening danger is assumed to produce  in tandem  increases in both vigilance toward threat and stressrelated symptoms  but no data test the validity of this assumption  the authors examined associations  in real time  among imminent lifethreatening danger  stressrelated symptoms  and vigilance  method  symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd   depression  and anxiety were measured in a civilian population  n131  as a function of warrelated stress  operationalized as the time available for seeking cover from rocket attack  a computerized measure of threatrelated vigilance using a classic dotprobe attention task was also collected  results  ptsd symptoms  depression  and anxiety increased as a function of warrelated threat  acute proximal threat was associated with avoidance of  rather than vigilance toward  negative valence information  for participants within rocket range  the magnitude of threat bias varied with the magnitude of distress symptoms  such that as bias away from threat increased  distress symptoms increased  conclusions  these data challenge current thinking about the role of attention in stress responding  attentional threat avoidance may reduce the acute impact of imminent threat  but this may come at a price in terms of an elevated risk for psychopathology  learned safety  a learning process in which a cue becomes associated with the absence of threat  is disrupted in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd   a bidirectional relationship exists between smoking and ptsd and one potential explanation is that nicotineassociated changes in cognition facilitate ptsd emotional dysregulation by disrupting safety associations  therefore  we investigated whether nicotine would disrupt learned safety by enhancing fear associated with a safety cue  in the present study  c57bl6 mice were administered acute or chronic nicotine and trained over three days in a differential backward trace conditioning paradigm consisting of five trials of a forward conditioned stimulus  cs    light  coterminating with a footshock unconditioned stimulus followed by a backward cs  tone  presented 20 s after cessation of the unconditioned stimulus  summation testing found that acute nicotine disrupted learned safety  but chronic nicotine had no effect  another group of animals administered acute nicotine showed fear when presented with the backward cs  light  alone  indicating the formation of a maladaptive fear association with the backward cs  finally  we investigated the brain regions involved by administering nicotine directly into the dorsal hippocampus  ventral hippocampus  and prelimbic cortex  infusion of nicotine into the dorsal hippocampus disrupted safety learning  there is mounting evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce human fear  we previously reported that administration of cortisol acutely reduced nonspatial selective attention to fearful faces and likewise reduced preferential processing of fearful faces in a spatial working memory task  here we report the acute effects of 40 mg cortisol  administered in a doubleblind  placebocontrolled crossover design  on a different experimental task for measuring threatselective attention  twenty healthy young males had to localize a target which was presented in a peripheral location that was either gazed at or not by a preceding dynamic happy or fearful face  this reliable method has been used repeatedly to demonstrate feardriven selective attention  present results showed that after placebo  as usual  the fearful gaze cues caused stronger orienting of attention than happy faces  cortisol abolished this typical anxious response pattern  but only in low anxious participants  these data provide evidence that cortisol acutely influences also spatial threatselective attention  possible neuroendocrine mechanisms are discussed  although the longacting opiate methadone is commonly used to treat drug addiction  relatively little is known about the effects of withdrawal from this drug in preclinical models  the current study examined affective  neuroendocrine  and somatic signs of withdrawal from the longeracting methadone derivative lalphaacetylmethydol  laam  in rats  anxietylike behavior during both spontaneous and antagonistprecipitated withdrawal was measured by potentiation of the startle reflex  withdrawal elevated corticosterone and somatic signs and blunted circadian variations in baseline startle responding  in addition  fear to an explicit  pavlovian conditioned stimulus  fearpotentiated startle  was enhanced  these data suggest that anxietylike behavior as measured using potentiated startle responding does not emerge spontaneously during withdrawal from chronic opiate exposure  in contrast to withdrawal from acute drug exposure  but rather is manifested as exaggerated fear in response to explicit threat cues  latelatency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials are sensitive to some centrally acting drugs and to certain psychological interventions  in this experiment we compared the effects of acute doses of a benzodiazepine  diazepam and an h  1  histamine receptorblocking sedative  diphenhydramine  on auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials within the latency range 100500 ms in a fear conditioning paradigm  twelve healthy males  1830 years  participated in three sessions at weekly intervals in which they received diazepam 10mg  diphenhydramine 75 mg and placebo in a balanced  doubleblind  crossover protocol  one hundred and twenty min after diphenhydramine or 60 min after diazepam  they underwent an 8 min recording period in which auditory evoked potentials elicited by 40 ms  95 db  a   1 khz tones  and somatosensory evoked potentials elicited by a mildly painful electric shock  18 ma  50 ms  were recorded at cz  vertex   each session consisted of four blocks of trials in which either the sound pulse or the shock was presented  alternate blocks were designated safe or threat  context  conditions   in threat blocks subjects were warned that shocks would be delivered via electrodes placed on the wrist  electrodes were removed during safe blocks   in one safe and one threat block  the sound stimuli and shocks  shocks were delivered only in the threat block  were preceded by a 2 s conditioned stimulus  cs  a red light   cue  condition   diazepam  but not diphenhydramine  reduced the amplitude of the p2 auditory evoked potential  the threat context was associated with increased n1 and reduced n2 potential amplitudes  the cs had no effect on the amplitudes  but markedly reduced the latencies of the n1  p2 and n2 potentials under the threat condition  diazepam reduced the amplitudes of the somatosensory potential evoked by the shock  the cs shortened the latencies of the later components of the response  diazepam and diphenhydramine were approximately equisedative in the doses used in this experiment  as judged by visual analogue selfrating scales  the results indicate that the suppression of latelatency auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials by diazepam is not simply a reflection of sedation  latelatency evoked potentials can be modified by an aversive cs  but the components that are sensitive to the cs are different from those that are sensitive to diazepam  background  recent laboratory studies have shown that acute alcohol intoxication selectively and effectively dampens aversive responding to uncertain threat  an emerging hypothesis is that individuals who exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat may be especially motivated to use alcohol to dampen their distress  setting the stage for negative reinforcement processes to drive excessive alcohol use  however  no study to date has directly examined whether current problematic drinkers exhibit heightened reactivity to uncertain threat as would be expected  methods  the present study was therefore designed to examine the association between current problematic alcohol use and reactivity to uncertain threat during sobriety in two  independent samples  in study 1  n221  and study 2  n74   adult participants completed the same wellvalidated threatofshock task which separately probes responses to temporally predictable and unpredictable threat  startle potentiation was measured as an index of aversive responding  problematic alcohol use was defined as number of binge episodes within the past 30days in study 1 and total scores on a selfreport measure of hazardous drinking in study 2  results  as hypothesized  across both studies greater levels of problematic drinking were associated with greater startle potentiation to unpredictable threat  in study 2  hazardous drinking scores were also positively associated with startle potentiation to predictable threat  conclusions  the findings are notably consistent with the notion that heightened reactivity to uncertain threat is an important individual difference factor associated with the onset andor maintenance of problematic drinking behaviors and may therefore be a novel prevention and intervention target  deep brain stimulation  dbs  has in some cases been associated with significant psychological effects andor personality change  these effects occur sometimes as acute changes experienced intraoperatively or during the initial setting of the stimulator and sometimes as longer term progressive changes in the months following surgery  sometimes they are the intended outcome of treatment  and in other cases they are an unintended sideeffect  in all of these circumstances some patients and caregivers have described the psychological effects of dbs as frightening or disconcerting  i trace the source of these negative reactions to the fear that stimulationrelated psychological and personality changes represent a threat to personal identity and agency  this issue has implications both for philosophical theories of personal identity and agency and for clinical concerns  a narrative account of personal identity is developed to illuminate the nature of the threat to identity and agency dbs potentially poses  and to suggest steps that might be taken to mitigate and avoid these threats  peritraumatic responses  aside from dissociation  have been understudied in acute trauma populations  participants were 172 female rape  68 assault  and 80 robbery victims recruited through formal reporting agencies and assessed 1 month after the crime  despite substantial overlap across crimes  rape victims reported more emotional responses reflecting fear  detachment  shame  and more nonactive behavioral responses  regression analysis examining the prediction of perceived threat by peritraumatic responses and crime variables indicated that increased duration of crimes  decreased calmness  increased fear  numbing  use of begging  pleading  and crying  and attempts to reason with the perpetrator  s  were all significantly associated with increased appraisal of threat  excessive stress exposure often leads to emotional dysfunction  characterized by disruptions in healthy emotional learning  expression  and regulation processes  a prefrontal cortex  pfc  amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes  however  limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress  therefore  the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri  to investigate stressinduced changes in pfcamygdala function during pavlovian fear conditioning  participants completed a variant of the montreal imaging stress task  mist  followed  25min later  by a pavlovian fear conditioning task during fmri  selfreported stress to the mist was used to identify three stressreactivity groups  low  medium  and high   psychophysiological  behavioral  and fmri signal responses were compared between the three stressreactivity groups during fear conditioning  fear learning  indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning  increased with stress reactivity  further  the high stressreactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal  ie  skin conductance response  scr  to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the low and medium stressreactivity groups  finally  the high stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat  more specifically  the high stressreactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned scrs  stressinduced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral  dorsomedial  and ventromedial pfc function  these findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning  enhances autonomic arousal  and impairs emotion regulation  and suggests these stressinduced changes in emotional function are mediated by the pfc  background  leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  hsct  create physical  psychological  social  and spiritual distresses in patients  understanding this threatening situation in adults with leukemia undergoing hsct will assist health care professionals in providing holistic care to the patients  objectives  the aim of the present study was exploring the perceived threat in adults with leukemia undergoing hsct  patients and methods  this article is part of a longitudinal qualitative study which used the grounded theory approach and was conducted in 20092011  ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for hsct were recruited from the hematologyoncology research center and stem cell transplantation  shariati hospital in tehran  iran  a series of pretransplant and posttransplant indepth interviews were held in the hospital s hsct wards  totally  18 interviews were conducted  three written narratives were also obtained from the participants  the corbin and strauss approach was used to analyze the data  results  perceived threat was one of the main categories that emerged from the data  this category included four subcategories   inattention to the signs and symptoms    doubt and anxiety    perception of danger and time limitation  and  change of life conditions   which occurred in linear progression over time  conclusion  suffering from leukemia and experiencing hsct are events that are uniquely perceived by patients  this threatening situation can significantly effect perception of patients and cause temporary or permanent alterations in patients  lives  health care professionals can help these patients by deeper understanding of their experiences and effective interventions  this study examined the effects of oral administration of 20mg hydrocortisone on baseline and fearpotentiated startle in 63 male veterans with or without ptsd  the procedure was based on a twosession  withinsubject design in which acoustic startle eyeblink responses were recorded during intervals of threat or no threat of electric shock  results showed that the magnitude of the difference between startle responses recorded during anticipation of imminent shock compared to  safe  periods was reduced after hydrocortisone administration relative to placebo  this effect did not vary as a function of ptsd group nor were there were any significant group differences in other indices startle amplitude  findings suggest that the acute elevations in systemic cortisol produced by hydrocortisone administration may have fearinhibiting effects  this finding may have implications for understanding the role of hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal  hpa  axis function in vulnerability and resilience to traumatic stress  two things are worth remembering about an aversive event  what made it happen  what made it cease  if a stimulus precedes an aversive event  it becomes a signal for threat and will later elicit behavior indicating conditioned fear  however  if the stimulus is presented upon cessation of the aversive event  it elicits behavior indicating conditioned  relief   what are the neuronal bases for such learning  using functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri  in humans we found that a fearconditioned stimulus activates amygdala but not striatum  whereas a reliefconditioned stimulus activates striatum but not amygdala  correspondingly  acute inactivation of amygdala or of ventral striatum in rats respectively abolished only conditioned fear or only conditioned relief  thus  the behaviorally opponent memories supported by onset and offset of aversive events engage and require fear and reward networks  respectively  this may explain attraction to stimuli associated with the cessation of trauma or of panic attacks  serotonin is strongly implicated in the mammalian stress response  but surprisingly little is known about its mode of action  recent data suggest that serotonin can inhibit aversive responding in humans  but this remains underspecified  in particular  data in rodents suggest that global serotonin depletion may specifically increase longduration bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  bnst  mediated aversive responses  ie  anxiety   but not shortduration bnstindependent responses  ie  fear   here  we extend these findings to humans  in a balanced  placebocontrolled crossover design  healthy volunteers  n20  received a controlled diet with and without the serotonin precursor tryptophan  acute tryptophan depletion  atd   aversive states were indexed by translational acoustic startle measures  fear and anxiety were operationally defined as the increase in startle reactivity during short and longduration threat periods evoked by predictable shock  fearpotentiated startle  and by the context in which the shocks were administered  anxietypotentiated startle   respectively  atd significantly increased longduration anxietypotentiated startle but had no effect on shortduration fearpotentiated startle  these results suggest that serotonin depletion in humans selectively increases anxiety but not fear  current translational frameworks support the proposition that atd thus disinhibits dorsal rapheoriginating serotonergic control of corticotropinreleasing hormonemediated excitation of the bnst  this generates a candidate neuropharmacological mechanism by which depleted serotonin may increase response to sustained threats  alongside clear implications for our understanding of the manifestation and treatment of mood and anxiety disorders  posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd  is associated with dysfunction of the neural circuitry that supports fear learning and memory processes  however  much of what is known about neural dysfunction in ptsd is based on research in chronic ptsd populations  less is known about neural function that supports fear learning acutely following trauma exposure  determining the acute effects of trauma exposure on brain function would provide new insight into the neural processes that mediate the cognitiveaffective dysfunction associated with ptsd  therefore  the present study investigated neural activity that supports fear learning and memory processes in recently traumaexposed  te  and nontraumaexposed  nte  participants  participants completed a pavlovian fear conditioning procedure during functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri   during fmri  participants  threat expectancy was continuously monitored  nte participants showed greater threat expectancy during warning than safety cues  while no difference was observed in the te group  this finding suggests te participants overgeneralized the fear association to the safety cue  further  only the te group showed a negative relationship between fmri signal responses within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex  pfc  and threat expectancy during safety cues  these results suggest the dorsomedial pfc mediates overgeneralization of learned fear as an acute result of trauma exposure  finally  neural activity within the pfc and inferior parietal lobule showed a negative relationship with ptsd symptom severity assessed three months posttrauma  thus  neural activity measured acutely following trauma exposure predicted future ptsd symptom severity  the present findings elucidate the acute effects of trauma exposure on cognitiveaffective function and provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of ptsd  as a step toward addressing limitations in the current psychiatric diagnostic system  the national institute of mental health recently developed the research domain criteria  rdoc  to stimulate integrative researchspanning selfreport  behavior  neural circuitry  and moleculargenetic mechanismson core psychological processes implicated in mental illness  here  we use the rdoc conceptualization to review research on threat responses  reward processing  and their interaction  the first section of the manuscript highlights the pivotal role of exaggerated threat responsesmediated by circuits connecting the frontal cortex  amygdala  and midbrainin anxiety  and reviews data indicating that genotypic variation in the serotonin system is associated with hyperactivity in this circuitry  which elevates the risk for anxiety and mood disorders  in the second section  we describe mounting evidence linking anhedonic behavior to deficits in psychological functions that rely heavily on dopamine signaling  especially costbenefit decision making and reward learning  the third section covers recent studies that document negative effects of acute threats and chronic stress on reward responses in humans  the mechanisms underlying such effects are unclear  but the fourth section reviews new optogenetic data in rodents indicating that gabaergic inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons  driven by activation of the habenula  may play a fundamental role in stressinduced anhedonia  in addition to its basic scientific value  a better understanding of interactions between the neural systems that mediate threat and reward responses may offer relief from the burdensome condition of anxious depression  in today s world  massmedia and online social networks present us with unprecedented exposure to secondhand  vicarious experiences and thereby the chance of forming associations between previously innocuous events  eg  being in a subway station  and aversive outcomes  eg  footage or verbal reports from a violent terrorist attack  without direct experience  such social threat  or fear  learning can have dramatic consequences  as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears  however  most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior  in three experiments  n  120   we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making  we contrasted learning from direct experience  ie  pavlovian conditioning   experiment 1  against two common forms of social threat learningsocial observation  experiment 2  and verbal instruction  experiment 3  and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling  we found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner  notably  computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms  our results demonstrate the strong influence of others  expressions of fear on one s own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events  cognitive theories of anxiety psychopathology cite biased attention towards threat as a central vulnerability and maintaining factor  however  many studies have found threat bias indices to have poor reliability and have failed to observe the theorized relationship between threat bias and anxiety symptoms  this may be due to the nonunitary nature of threat bias and the influence of statelevel variables on its expression  accumulating data suggests that state anxious mood is important for the robust expression of threat bias and for relations to emerge between threat bias and symptoms  though this possibility has not been experimentally tested  eyetracking was used to assess multiple forms of threat bias  ie  early vigilance  sustained attention  facilitated engagement  delayed disengagement  thought to be related to anxiety  a nonclinical sample  n  165  was recruited to test the hypothesis that biased attention towards threat  but not dysphoric or positive emotional stimuli  during an anxious mood induction  but not at a prestress baseline  would prospectively predict greater worry symptoms on days in which more naturalistic stressors occurred  results revealed the hypothesized moderation effect for sustained attention towards threat after the mood induction but not at baseline  though sustained attention towards dysphoric stimuli also moderated the effect of stressors on worry  worryrelevant sustained attention towards negative emotional stimuli may be a partially moodcontext dependent phenomenon  the behavioral analysis of laboratory rats is usually confined to the level of overt behavior  like locomotion  behavioral inhibition  instrumental responses  and others  apart from such visible outcome  however  behaviorally relevant information can also be obtained when analyzing the animals  ultrasonic vocalization  which is typically emitted in highly motivational situations  like 22khz calls in response to acute or conditioned threat  to further investigate such vocalizations and their relationship with overt behavior  we tested male wistar rats in a paradigm of pavlovian fear conditioning  where a tone stimulus  cs  was preceding an aversive footshock  us  in a distinct environment  importantly  the shock dose was varied between groups  011 ma   and its acute and conditioned outcome were determined  the analysis of visible behavior confirms the usefulness of immobility as a measure of fear conditioning  especially when higher shock doses were used  rearing and grooming  on the other hand  were more useful to detect conditioned effects with lower shock levels  ultrasonic vocalization occurred less consistently than changes in overt behavior  however  doseresponse relationships were also observed during the phase of conditioning  for example  in latency  call rate and lengths  intervals between calls  and sound amplitude  furthermore  total calling time  and rate  were highly correlated with overt behavior  namely behavioral inhibition as measured through immobility  these correlations were observed during the phase of fear conditioning  and the subsequent tests  importantly  conditioned effects in overt behavior were observed  both  to the context and to the cs presented in this context  whereas conditioned vocalization to the context was not observed  except for one rat   in support and extent of previous results  the present data show that a detailed analysis of ultrasonic vocalization can substantially broaden and refine the spectrum of analysis in behavioral work with rats  since it can provide information about situational  state  and subjectdependent factors which are partly distinct from what is visible to the experimenter  social fearfulness is expressed on a continuum of severity from moderate distress to incapacitating fear  the present article focuses on the brain states associated with this broad dimension of social anxiety in humans  in total  70 published studies are summarized documenting the neural correlates of social anxiety during states of rest  threatrelated cognitiveaffective activation  and acute symptom provocation  neural exaggeration in limbic  amygdala  and paralimbic  insula  regions appears to be associated with functional outcomes involving increased attention for and processing of social threat  evidence is also reviewed showing that social anxiety is characterized by atypical functional connectivity in certain brain networks  despite a higher prevalence of social anxiety disorder among females  males have been overrepresented in the published clinical studies  constituting approximately 56  of the total participants   we evaluate the prospects of nonhuman animal models of social anxiety and discuss several promising directions for future research  the review highlights the need to adopt an integrative  networkbased approach to the study of the neural substrates underlying social anxiety  exposure to a deadly threat  an adult male rat  induced the release of corticosterone in 14dayold rat pups  the endocrine stress response was decreased when the pups were reunited with their mother immediately after exposure  these findings demonstrate that social variables can reduce the consequences of an aversive experience  recent findings obtained in patients with phobias or traumarelated anxiety disorders raise doubts concerning the interrelation between acute fear relief during an exposurebased therapeutic session and beneficial treatment progress  in a mouse model explicit for exposure therapy  we challenge the view that withinsession fear reduction is the turning point for relearning of a stimulusthreat association  even though withinsession extinction of auditorycued fear memory was identical for prolonged and spaced tone presentations  only the latter caused betweensession extinction  furthermore  spaced tone presentations led to betweensession extinction even in the complete absence of withinsession extinction  as observed for remote fear memories and in case of abolished cannabinoid receptor type 1 signaling  induction of betweensession extinction was accompanied by an increase in the number of cfospositive neurons within the basolateral amygdala  the cingulate cortex  and the dentate gyrus  independent of the level of withinsession extinction  together  our findings demonstrate that withinsession extinction is neither sufficient nor essential for betweensession extinction  thus calling for a reconsideration of current concepts underlying exposurebased therapies  psychophysiological measures of fear expression provide observable intermediate phenotypes of fearrelated symptoms  research domain criteria  rdoc  advocate using neurobiological intermediate phenotypes that provide dimensional correlates of psychopathology  negative valence systems in the rdoc matrix include the construct of acute threat  which can be measured on a physiological level using potentiation of the acoustic startle reflex assessed via electromyography recordings of the orbicularis oculi muscle  impairments in extinction of fearpotentiated startle due to high levels of fear  termed fear load  during the early phases of extinction have been observed in posttraumatic stress disorder  ptsd   the goals of the current work were to examine dimensional associations between fearrelated symptoms of ptsd and fear load variables to test their validity as an intermediate phenotype  we examined extinction of fearpotentiated startle in a cohort  n269  of individuals with a broad range of civilian trauma exposure  range 013 traumatic events per person  mean35   based on previously reported findings  we hypothesized that fear load would be significantly associated with intrusion and fear memories of an index traumatic event  the results indicated that early extinction was correlated with intrusive thoughts  p00007  and intense physiological reactions to trauma reminders  p0036   degree of adult or childhood trauma exposure  and depression severity were not associated with fear load  after controlling for age  sex  race  income  level of prior trauma  and level of fear conditioning  fear load during extinction was still significantly predictive of intrusive thoughts  p0004   the significance of these findings is that they support dimensional associations with symptom severity rather than diagnostic category and  as such  fear load may emerge as a transdiagnostic intermediate phenotype expressed across fearrelated disorders  eg  specific phobia  social phobia   development of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal  hpa  axis is influenced by external factors during early life in mammals  which optimizes adult function for predicted conditions  we have hypothesized that adolescence represents a sensitive period for the development of some aspects of adult stress response regulation  this was based on prior work showing that repeated exposure of rats to a stressor across an adolescent period increases fearfulness in a novel environment in adulthood and results in lower levels of dopamine receptor subtype2 protein in prefrontal cortex  here  we further our investigation of both acute and longterm effects of repeated adolescent stressor exposure on physiological  ie  corticosterone  and behavioral  ie  defensive behavior  measures of stress responding in male and female rats  furthermore  we compared outcomes with those following identical manipulations administered in early adulthood and found that animals exposed to cues of predation threat during adolescence showed the most robust defensive responses to a homotypic stressor encountered in adulthood  peer interaction during control manipulation in adolescence was identified as an important individual characteristic mediating development of adult defensive strategies  aims  this study was primarily aimed for developing and testing a valid and reliable instrument that measures perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection after organ transplantation  a second aim was to report descriptive data regarding graft rejection and healthrelated quality of life  background  the most serious risk connected with transplantations besides infection is graft rejection  design  non experimental  descriptive involving instrument development and psychometric assessment  method  questionnaires about perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection and healthrelated quality of life were mailed to 229 otrs between 1965 years old  the items were formed from a previous interview study  patients were transplanted with a kidney  a liver or a heart andor a lung  all patients with followup time of one year  three months and three years  three months were included  results  with an 81  response rate  the study comprised of 185 otrs  who had received either a kidney  n  117   a liver  n  39  or heart or lung  n  29   three homogenous factors of perceived threat for graft rejection were revealed  labelled intrusive anxiety   graftrelated threat  and lack of control   tests of internal consistency showed good itemscale convergent and discriminatory validity  a majority of the otrs scored low levels for intrusive anxiety   the kidney transplant recipients experienced more graftrelated threat  by acute graft rejection than those transplanted with a liver  heart or lung  conclusion  in conclusion  this study suggests that it is possible to measure the perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection in three homogenous factors  relevance to clinical practice  the instrument perceived threat of the risk for graft rejection  might be usable to measure the impact of fear of graft rejection  to predict needs of pedagogical intervention strategies to reduce fear and to improve healthrelated quality of life related to graft rejection  recent evidence suggests that the steroid hormone testosterone can decrease the functional coupling between orbitofrontal cortex  ofc  and amygdala  theoretically this decoupling has been linked to a testosteronedriven increase of goaldirected behaviour in case of threat  but this has never been studied directly  therefore  we placed twentytwo women in dynamically changing situations of escapable and inescapable threat after a withinsubject placebo controlled testosterone administration  using functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri  we provide evidence that testosterone activates the left lateral ofc  lofc  in preparation of active goaldirected escape and decouples this ofc area from a subcortical threat system including the centralmedial amygdala  hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray  this lofc decoupling was specific to threatening situations  a point that was further emphasized by an absence of such decoupling in a second experiment focused on restingstate connectivity  these results not only confirm that testosterone administration decouples the lofc from the subcortical threat system  but also show that this is specifically the case in response to acute threat  and ultimately leads to an increase in lofc activity when the participant prepares a goaldirected action to escape  together these results for the first time provide a detailed understanding of functional brain alterations induced by testosterone under threat conditions  and corroborate and extend the view that testosterone prepares the brain for goaldirected action in case of threat  serotonin reuptake inhibitors may increase symptoms of anxiety immediately following treatment initiation  the present study examined whether acute citalopram increased fearpotentiated startle to predictable andor unpredictable shocks in healthy subjects  eighteen healthy subjects each received two treatments  placebo and 20 mg citalopram in a crossover design  participants were exposed to three conditions including one in which predictable aversive shocks were signaled by a cue  a second in which unpredictable shocks were anticipated  and a third in which no shocks were administered  changes in aversive states were investigated using acoustic startle stimuli  citalopram did not affect baseline startle  however  the phasic startle potentiation to the threat cue in the predictable condition was robustly increased by acute citalopram  the sustained startle potentiation in the unpredictable conditions was also increased by citalopram  but only when the drug was given during the first session  these results indicate that a single dose of citalopram is not anxiogenic in itself  but can exacerbate the expression of fear and anxiety  phan et al   2008  recently reported that an acute dose of oral thc is associated with a decrease in threatrelated amygdala reactivity during a social threat stimulus task  however  to date  those findings have not been replicated  and have not been extended to clinical studies involving smoked rather than oral cannabis  in this study  we hypothesized that level of cannabis smoked by participants in our treatment study would be inversely related to the level of threatrelated amygdala reactivity  subjects were recruited from among participants in our doubleblind  placebocontrolled trial of fluoxetine in comorbid youth with cannabis dependencemajor depression  the threatrelated amygdala reactivity task used by hariri et al   2009  was completed during bold fmri scans at study baseline and then again 12 weeks later at the end of the trial  data are available from six subjects with preand posttreatment fmri data  during the course of the study  five of the six subjects demonstrated a decrease in their level of cannabis use  with a mean decrease of 64   and those persons all demonstrated an increase in their level of amygdala reactivity  one subject demonstrated an increase in their level of cannabis use  a 79  increase  during the treatment trial  and that person demonstrated a decrease in their level of amygdala reactivity  thus  a higher level of cannabis use was consistently associated with a lower level of amygdala reactivity across all subjects  matched pairs t  270  df  5  p  005  twotailed   these findings are consistent with the reports by phan et al   2008  and hariri et al   2009  suggesting that cannabinoids have an inhibitory effect on threatrelated amygdala reactivity  stress broadly affects the ability to regulate emotions and may contribute to generalization of threatrelated behaviors to harmless stimuli  behavioral generalization also tends to increase over time as memory precision for recent events gives way to more gistlike representations  thus  acute stress coupled with a delay in time from a negative experience may be a strong predictor of the transition from normal to generalized fear expression  here  we investigated the effect of a singleepisode acute stressor on generalization of aversive learning when stress is administered either immediately after an aversive learning event or following a delay  in a betweensubjects design  healthy adult volunteers underwent threat  fear  conditioning using a toneconditioned stimulus paired with an electric shock to the wrist and another tone not paired with shock  behavioral generalization was tested to a range of novel tones either on the same day  experiment 1  or 24 h later  experiment 2  and was preceded by either an acute stress induction or a control task  anticipatory sympathetic arousal  ie  skin conductance responses  scrs   and explicit measures of shock expectancy served as dependent measures  stress administered shortly after threat conditioning did not affect behavioral generalization  in contrast  stress administered following a delay led to heightened arousal and increased generalization of scrs and explicit measures of shock expectancy  these findings show that acute stress increases generalization of older but not recent threat memories and have clinical relevance to understanding overgeneralization characteristics of anxiety and stressrelated disorders  objective  to examine whether exposure to curve versus sharp contours in the built healthcare setting produces systematic and identifiable patterns of amygdala activation and behavioral response in healthy adults  background  recent studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that humans prefer objects with a curved contour compared with objects that have pointed features and a sharpangled contour  an implicit perception of threat represented by sharp objects  in humans  was hypothesized to explain this bias  method  the study adopted a withinsubject experimental design  where 36 subjects  representing three agegroups and both sexes  were exposed to a randomized order of 312 reallife images  objects  interiors  exteriors  landscape  and a set of control images   amygdala activation was simultaneously captured using functional magnetic resonance imaging technology  subjects  preference  likedislike  data were also collected while in the scanner  data were collected in 2013  results  in case of images depicting landscape and healthcare objects  brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with sharp contours  however  in relation to images depicting hospital interiors and exterior envelops  brain scans show significant higher amygdala activation associated with curve contours  these activations pertain to exposure during the precognitive stages of the subjects  perception  conclusion  hospital forms do have systematic impact on fear response during precognitive stages of human perception  whether this first impression colors the subsequent experience of an actual patient with real illness or injury is unknown  the nimh research domain criteria  rdoc  initiative aims to describe key dimensional constructs underlying mental function across multiple units of analysisfrom genes to observable behaviorsin order to better understand psychopathology  the acute threat   fear   construct of the rdoc negative valence system has been studied extensively from a translational perspective  and is highly pertinent to numerous psychiatric conditions  including anxiety and traumarelated disorders  we examined genetic contributions to the construct of acute threat at two units of analysis within the rdoc framework   1  neural circuits and  2  physiology  specifically  we focused on genetic influences on activation patterns of frontolimbic neural circuitry and on startle  skin conductance  and heart rate responses  research on the heritability of activation in threatrelated frontolimbic neural circuitry is lacking  but physiological indicators of acute threat have been found to be moderately heritable  3550    genetic studies of the neural circuitry and physiology of acute threat have almost exclusively relied on the candidate gene method and  as in the broader psychiatric genetics literature  most findings have failed to replicate  the most robust support has been demonstrated for associations between variation in the serotonin transporter  slc6a4  and catecholomethyltransferase  comt  genes with threatrelated neural activation and physiological responses  however  unbiased genomewide approaches using very large samples are needed for gene discovery  and these can be accomplished with collaborative consortiumbased research efforts  such as those of the psychiatric genomics consortium  pgc  and enhancing neuro imaging genetics through metaanalysis  enigma  consortium  patients with generalized social anxiety disorder  gsad  exhibit heightened activation of the amygdala in response to social cues conveying threat  eg  fearfulangry faces   the neuropeptide oxytocin  oxt  decreases anxiety and stress  facilitates social encounters  and attenuates amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in healthy subjects  the goal of this study was to examine the effects of oxt on fearrelated amygdala reactivity in gsad and matched healthy control  con  subjects  in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a doubleblind placebocontrolled withinsubjects design  we measured amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful  angry  and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of oxt  24 iu or 4032 mug  and placebo in 18 gsad and 18 con subjects  both the con and gsad groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional faces during placebo  with the gsad group exhibiting hyperactivity specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the con group  oxt had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in the con group  but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in the gsad group  such that the hyperactivity observed during the placebo session was no longer evident following oxt  ie  normalization   these findings suggest that oxt has a specific effect on fearrelated amygdala activity  particularly when the amygdala is hyperactive  such as in gsad  thereby providing a brainbased mechanism of the impact of oxt in modulating the exaggerated processing of social signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety  the ability to adaptively regulate responses to the proximity of potential danger is critical to survival and imbalance in this system may contribute to psychopathology  the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  bnst  is implicated in defensive responding during uncertain threat anticipation whereas the amygdala may drive responding upon more acute danger  this functional dissociation between the bnst and amygdala is however controversial  and human evidence scarce  here we used data from two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies  n  108 males and n  70  45 females   to probe how coordination between the bnst and amygdala may regulate responses during shock anticipation and actual shock confrontation  in a subset of participants from sample 2  n  48  we demonstrate that anticipation and confrontation evoke bradycardic and tachycardic responses  respectively  further  we show that in each sample when going from shock anticipation to the moment of shock confrontation neural activity shifted from a region anatomically consistent with the bnst toward the amygdala  comparisons of functional connectivity during threat processing showed overlapping yet also consistently divergent functional connectivity profiles for the bnst and amygdala  finally  childhood maltreatment levels predicted amygdala  but not bnst  hyperactivity during shock anticipation  our results support an evolutionary conserved  defensive distancedependent dynamic balance between bnst and amygdala activity  shifts in this balance may enable shifts in defensive reactions via the demonstrated differential functional connectivity  our results indicate that early life stress may tip the neural balance toward acute threat responding and via that route predispose for affective disordersignificance statement previously proposed differential contributions of the bnst and amygdala to fear and anxiety have been recently debated  despite the significance of understanding their contributions to defensive reactions  there is a paucity of human studies that directly compared these regions on activity and connectivity during threat processing  we show strong evidence for a dissociable role of the bnst and amygdala in threat processing by demonstrating in two large participant samples that they show a distinct temporal signature of threat responding as well as a discriminable pattern of functional connections and differential sensitivity to early life threat  fear generalization occurs when a response  previously acquired with a threatening stimulus  is transferred to a similar one  however  it could be maladaptive when stimuli that do not represent a real threat are appraised as dangerous  which is a hallmark of several anxiety disorders  stress exposure is a major risk factor for the occurrence of anxiety disorders and it is well established that it influences different phases of fear memory  nevertheless  its impact on the generalization of contextual fear memories has been less studied  in the present work  we have characterized the impact of acute restraint stress prior to contextual fear conditioning on the generalization of this fear memory  and the role of the gabaergic signaling within the basolateral amygdala complex  bla  on the stress modulatory effects  we have found that a single stress exposure promoted the generalization of this memory trace to a different context that was well discriminated in unstressed conditioned animals  moreover  this effect was dependent on the formation of a contextual associative memory and on the testing order  ie  conditioning context first vs generalization context first   furthermore  we observed that increasing gabaa signaling by intrabla midazolam administration prior to the stressful session exposure prevented the generalization of fear memory  whereas intrabla administration of the gabaa antagonist  bicuculline   prior to fear conditioning  induced the generalization of fear memory in unstressed rats  we concluded that stress exposure  prior to contextual fear conditioning  promotes the generalization of fear memory and that the gabaergic transmission within the bla has a critical role in this phenomenon  objective  the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that greater global and situational relationship satisfaction would reduce the negative impact of threatening information on acute pain  design  an experimental design was used to manipulate threat and elicit acute pain via a cold pressor task  setting  the study was completed in a research laboratory at a large urban university in the midwestern usa  subjects  participants were 134 couples  in which at least one individual was an undergraduate student  methods  after administration of a global relationship satisfaction measure  couples were randomly assigned to either receive high or low threatening information about the painful task  following the threat manipulation  couples discussed the upcoming task and rated their satisfaction with the interaction  ie  situational relationship satisfaction   the designated pain participant then completed the painful task alone  results  the threat manipulation altered couples  perceived threat of pain  situational relationship satisfaction moderated the effect of threat on pain trajectories such that situational relationship satisfaction predicted less pain intensity at an earlier point in the task for the low threat condition than the high threat condition  greater global relationship satisfaction predicted greater likelihood of task completion among those in the low threat condition  whereas it was unrelated to task completion in the high threat condition  greater global relationship satisfaction also predicted lower pain intensity throughout the task  conclusions  these findings demonstrate that the interpersonal context is independently related to acute pain and may also alter the effect of threatening information on acute pain  chronically elevated hpa activity has often been associated with fear and anxiety  but there is evidence that single administrations of glucocorticoids may acutely reduce fear  moreover  peritraumatic cortisol elevation may protect against development of posttraumatic stress disorder  hypervigilant processing of threat information plays a role in anxiety disorders and although relations with hpa functioning have been established  causality of these relations remains unclear  presently  selfreported anxiety and response time patterns on a masked emotional stroop task with fearful faces were measured in 20 healthy young men after doubleblind  placebocontrolled oral administration of 40 mg cortisol  the masked fearful stroop task measures vocal colornaming response latencies for pictures of neutral and fearful faces presented below the threshold for conscious perception  results showed increased response times on trials for fearful compared to neutral faces after placebo  but this emotional stroop effect was acutely abolished by cortisol administration  this effect was most pronounced in subjects with heightened anxiety levels  this is the first evidence showing that exogenous cortisol acutely reduces anxietydriven selective attention to threat  these results extend earlier findings of acute fear reduction after glucocorticoid administration  this suggests interactions of hpa functioning and vigilant attention in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders  possible neuroendocrine mechanisms of action are discussed  the use of fear conditioning and extinction paradigms to examine intermediate phenotypes of anxiety and stressrelated disorders has facilitated the identification of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie specific components of abnormal psychological functioning  across species  acute pharmacologic manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system has provided evidence of its critical role in fear extinction  but the effects of chronic cannabis on extinction are relatively understudied  in rats  chronic cannabinoid administration impairs fear extinction in a drugfree state  here we examine whether chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired fear extinction in humans  participants were healthy chronic cannabis users  n  20  and nonuser controls with minimal lifetime cannabis use  n  20  matched on age  sex  and race who all screened negative for psychiatric disorders  a 2day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used to test the hypothesis that chronic cannabis use would be associated with impaired extinction of the skin conductance response  consistent with hypotheses  chronic cannabis use was associated with reduced withinsession extinction of skin conductance response on day 1  d  078   and betweensession extinction on day 2  d  076   unexpectedly  cannabis use was also associated with reduced subjective differentiation between threat and safety stimuli during conditioning  replication and translation of findings are necessary to test potential mechanisms directly and examine whether impairments can be reversed pharmacologically or after a period of cannabis abstinence   psycinfo database record rationale  in this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri  to examine the effects of acute tryptophan depletion  atd   a wellrecognised method for inducing transient cerebral serotonin depletion  on brain activation to fearful faces  objectives  we predicted that atd would increase the responsiveness of the amygdala to fearful faces as a function of individual variation in threat sensitivity  methods  twelve healthy male volunteers received a tryptophan depleting drink or a tryptophan balancing amino acid drink  placebo  in a doubleblind crossover design  five hours after drink ingestion participants were scanned whilst viewing fearful  happy and neutral faces  results  consistent with previous findings  fearful faces induced significant signal change in the bilateral amygdalahippocampus as well as the fusiform face area and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  furthermore  atd modulated amygdalahippocampus activation in response to fearful relative to happy faces as a function of selfreported threat sensitivity  as measured with the behavioral inhibition scale  carver cs  white tl  1994  behavioral inhibition  behavioral activation  and affective responses to impending reward and punishment  the bisbas scales  j pers soc psychol 67319333   conclusion  the data support the hypothesis that individual variation in threat sensitivity interacts with manipulation of 5ht function to bias the processing of amygdaladependent threatrelevant stimuli  fear promotes adaptive responses to threats  however  when the level of fear is not proportional to the level of threat  maladaptive fearrelated behaviors characteristic of anxiety disorders result  posttraumatic stress disorder develops in response to a traumatic event  and patients often show sensitized reactions to mild stressors associated with the trauma  stressenhanced fear learning  sefl  is a rodent model of this sensitized responding  in which exposure to a 15shock stressor nonassociatively enhances subsequent fear conditioning training with only a single trial  we examined the role of corticosterone  cort  in sefl  administration of the cort synthesis blocker metyrapone prior to the stressor  but not at time points after  attenuated sefl  moreover  cort coadministered with metyrapone rescued sefl  however  cort alone without the stressor was not sufficient to produce sefl  in these same animals  we then looked for correlates of sefl in terms of changes in excitatory receptor expression  western blot analysis of the basolateral amygdala  bla  revealed an increase in the glua1 ampa receptor subunit that correlated with sefl  thus  cort is permissive to traumainduced changes in bla function  acute pain informs the individual that there is an imminent threat of body damage  and is associated with the urge to escape and avoid  fear learning takes place when neutral stimuli receive the propensity to predict the occurrence of pain  and when defensive responses are initiated in anticipation of potential threats to the integrity of the body  fearavoidance models have been put forward featuring the role of individual differences in catastrophic interpretations of pain in the modulation of learning and avoidance  based on extensive literature on fear reduction in anxiety disorders  cognitivebehavioral treatments have been developed and applied to patients with chronic pain reporting substantial painrelated fear  in this article  we discuss mechanisms underlying the acquisition  the assessment and extinction of painrelated fear through the cognitivebehavioral treatment of painrelated fear  finally  we provide a number of critical notes and directions for future research in the field of chronic pain and painrelated fear '"
