Hello all,

Welcome to GitHub for our WiDS NLP project!

----

Below are a few commands that I find useful in this whole process:

1, git pull: To avoid merge conflicts and to make sure you’re working on the most updated version.

2. git status: Tracking which files have been modified.

3. git add [files]: Adding the changed files from your local machine to a loading-dock

4. git commit -m “Detailed message about what changes are incorporated”

5. git push: Pushing your loading-dock changes to the repository.

-----

And of course, if you have any questions please feel free to message me. 

Thanks! R,

Tyler
