Using current radioastronomical technology, it is possible for us to receive signals from civilizations no more advanced than we are over a distance of at least many thousands of light years. The cost of a systematic international research effort, using existing radio telescopes, is as low as a few million dollars per year for one or two decades. The program would be more than a million times more thorough than all previous searches, by all nations, put together. The results  whether positive or negative  would have profound implications for our view of our universe and ourselves. We believe such a coordinated search program is well justified on its scientific merits. It will also have important subsidiary benefits for radioastronomy in general. It is a scientific activity that seems likely to garner substantial public support. In addition, because of the growing problem of radiofrequency interference by civilian and military transmitters, the search program will become more difficult the longer we wait.

It seeks to develop a standard against which conduct of states can be measured. The author articulates two standards. One is the aspirational, political version of the right under which the state is to do what it can do to advance the health of the people. The other is a narrowly defined right which can be enforced in court. This narrowly defined right includes both a negative aspect (the state must refrain from doing things which negatively affect the health of the people) and an affirmative aspect. The affirmative right is that the right to health imposes a duty on a state to intervene or to act, to the extent of its available resources, to prevent or reduce or address serious threats to the health of individuals or the population."",""author"":[{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""S D Jamar"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/S-D-Jamar/50759942""}],""publication"":""Southern University law review.
